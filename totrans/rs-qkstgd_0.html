<p class="mce-root">Rust is system-level programming language with growing popularity. This popularity is driven by its semantics, which encourages the creation of fast, reliable software. In this book, we're going to learn the basics of the language, eventually getting to a point where we can begin writing usable programs.</p>

<p>At least some familiarity with another programming language will be helpful, for comparison and contrast. You will need an internet connection to download and install the compiler toolchain. The ability to use command-line tools is assumed.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Mount the downloaded <kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd> disk image file as another disk in your system."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>fn main() {<br/>     println!("Hello, world!");<br/> }<br/><br/></pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre><strong>if 3 &gt; 4 {</strong><br/>    println!("Uh-oh. Three is greater than four.");<br/>}<br/><strong>else if 3 == 4 {</strong><br/>    println!("There seems to be something wrong with math.");<br/>}</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ mkdir css</strong><br/><strong>$ cd css</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
<p class="mce-root"/>
