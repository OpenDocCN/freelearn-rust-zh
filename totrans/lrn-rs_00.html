<p class="calibre1">Rust is a new programming language. It offers performance and safety that is equivalent to, or even surpasses, modern C++ while being a modern language with a relatively low barrier to entry. Rust's momentum, combined with its active and friendly community, promise a great future for the language.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While modern and fluent, Rust is not a particularly easy language. The memory management system keeps track of the life of every entity that is used in your program and is designed in such a way that this tracking can typically happen entirely at compile time. The Rust programmer's burden is to help the compiler when it cannot decide for itself what should happen. Since modern programming is possible without ever facing such responsibilities, a modern programmer may not immediately feel comfortable with Rust.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, like all expertise and skill, the more difficult it is to attain, the more valuable it is, and this book is here to help you. This book covers the basics of Rust, enabling you to gain enough skills to start programming with it.</p>

<p class="calibre1">To really dive into the content of this book, you should write out the example code and do the exercises. For that, you'll need a fairly recent computer; a gigabyte of RAM should be enough for the purposes of this book, but the more you have the faster the builds will be.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Linux is the best supported operating system here, but Rust itself is a first-class citizen on macOS and recent versions of Windows, so all the examples should adapt well there.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Who this book is for</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre1">This book will appeal to application developers who would like to build applications with Rust. No knowledge of programming is required.</p>

<p class="calibre1">In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning. Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "A shorter form is available in the <kbd class="calibre10">unwrap</kbd> method. This is the same as the <kbd class="calibre10">expect</kbd> method, but it doesn't print out anything in case of a failure."</p>
<p class="calibre1">A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="calibre21">let mut file = File::create("myxml_file.xml).unwrap(); 
let mut output = io::stdout(); 
let mut input = io::stdin(); </pre>
<p class="calibre1">Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre class="calibre21"><strong class="calibre8">cd app_name </strong>
<strong class="calibre8">cargo build app_name</strong>  </pre>
<p class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre8">New terms</strong> and <strong class="calibre8">important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Open up Visual Studio Code and go to the Command Palette, either by the View menu or by the keyboard shortcut <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">Shift</em> + <em class="calibre9">P</em> (which may differ between platforms)."</p>
<p>Warnings or important notes appear like this.</p>
<p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p>
