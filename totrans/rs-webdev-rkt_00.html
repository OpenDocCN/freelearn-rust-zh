			<p>Rocket is one of the first web frameworks in the Rust programming language. Rocket provides complete tooling to build web applications, such as tools for routing the requests and the strong typing of the incoming requests, and middleware to manipulate incoming requests and outgoing responses. Rocket also provides support for templating and connections to various databases.</p>
			<p>Rocket is a web framework written in the Rust programming language. As one of the newer programming languages, Rust is designed to be performant and safe. It is easy to create a safe, multithreaded, and asynchronous application. Rust also has a strong foundation in its tooling, documentation, and community packages. All those strengths contribute to Rust's rapid growth in popularity.</p>
			<p>This book explores building a complete web application using the Rocket web framework and the Rust programming language. You will be introduced to various techniques to build a web application that can handle incoming requests, store the data in an RDBMS, and generate proper responses back to any HTTP clients. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>We wrote this book to help software engineers who want to learn how to use the Rocket web framework to build web applications. Although not mandatory, basic knowledge of the Rust programming language will help you understand the topics covered easily.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>You will need a Rust compiler by installing Rustup and the stable toolchain on your computer. You can use Linux, macOS, or Windows. For macOS users, it is recommended to use Homebrew. For Windows users, it is recommended to install Rustup using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL or WSL 2).</p>
			<p>All the code in this book has been tested on Arch Linux and macOS, but they should work on other Linux distributions or the Windows operating system as well. </p>

			<p>Since Rust is a compiled language, various development headers might have to be installed on your computer, for example, <code>libssl-dev</code> or <code>libpq-dev</code>. Pay attention to error messages when compiling the code sample in this book, and install the required libraries for your operating system and development environment if needed. </p>
			<p>Further along in the book, in <a href="B16825_10_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor118"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, we are going to process videos using the <code>FFmpeg</code> command line.</p>
