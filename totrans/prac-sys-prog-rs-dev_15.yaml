    thread safety. While this is a blessing most of the time, there may be situations
    when you want to implement a new low-level data structure or call out to external
    programs written in other languages. Or, you may want to perform other operations
    prohibited by the Rust compiler, such as dereferencing raw pointers, mutating
    static variables, or dealing with uninitialized memory. Have you wondered how
    the Rust Standard Library itself makes system calls to manage resources, when
    system calls involve dealing with raw pointers? The answer lies in understanding
    unsafe Rust and FFIs.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So far in this book, we've seen and used Rust language that enforces memory
    and type safety at compilation time and prevents various kinds of undefined behavior,
    such as memory overflows, null or invalid pointer constructions, and data races.
    This is *safe* Rust. In fact, the Rust Standard Library gives us good tools and
    utilities to write safe, idiomatic Rust, and helps to keep the program safe (and
    you sane!).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But in some situations, the compiler can *get in the way*. The Rust compiler
    performs static analysis of code that is conservative (meaning the Rust compiler
    does not mind generating a few false positives and rejecting valid code, as long
    as it does not let bad code get through). You, as a programmer, know that a piece
    of code is safe, but the compiler thinks it is risky, so it rejects this code.
    This includes operations such as system calls, type coercions, and direct manipulations
    of memory pointers, which are used in the development of several categories of
    system software.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another example is in embedded systems where registers are accessed through
    a fixed memory address and require the dereferencing of pointers. So, to enable
    such actions, the Rust language provides the `unsafe` keyword. For Rust as a system
    programming language, it is essential to enable the programmer to have the means
    to write low-level code to interface directly with the operating system, bypassing
    the Rust Standard Library if needed. *This is unsafe Rust*. This is the part of
    the Rust language that does not adhere to the rules of the borrow checker.
  prefs: []

- en: Unsafe Rust can be thought of as a superset of safe Rust. It is a superset because
    it allows you to do all the things you can do in standard Rust, but you can do
    more things that are otherwise prohibited by the Rust compiler. In fact, Rust's
    own compiler, and the standard library, include unsafe Rust code that is carefully
    written.

    pointers can have both immutable and mutable pointers to a value at the same time
    or have multiple pointers simultaneously to the same value in memory. There is
    no automatic cleanup of memory when these pointers go out of scope, and these
    pointers can be null or refer to invalid memory locations too. The guarantees

    into the required function input parameter type using the `as_ptr()` method. The

    non-Rust interfaces. We are using the `CString` and `CStr` types from the `ffi`
    module, to transfer UTF-8 strings to and from C. The `os::raw` module contains
    platform-specific types that map to the C data types so that the Rust code that

    features of Rust that deal with conditional compilation options, data layout conventions,
    and link options.

- en: The **ABI** is a set of conventions and standards that compilers and linkers
    adhere to, for function-calling conventions, and for specifying data layouts (type,
    alignment, offset).

- en: To understand the significance of the ABI, let's draw an analogy with APIs,
    which are a well-known concept in application programming. When a program wants
    to access an external component or library at the source-code level, it looks
    for the definition of the API exposed by that external component. The external
    component can be a library or an external service accessible over the network.
    The API specifies the name of the functions that can be called, the parameters
    (along with their names and data types) that need to be passed to invoke the function,
    and the type of value returned from the function.

- en: An ABI can be seen as the equivalent of an API but at the binary level. The
    compiler and linker need a way to specify how a calling program can locate the
    called function within a binary object file, and how to deal with the arguments
    and return values (types and order of arguments and return type). But unlike source
    code, in the case of the binaries produced, details such as the length of integers,
    padding rules, and whether the function parameters are stored on the stack or
    registers vary by platform architecture (for example, x86, x64, AArch32) and operating
    system (for example, Linux and Windows). A 64-bit operating system can have different
    ABIs for executing 32-bit and 64-bit binaries. A Windows-based program will not
    know how to access a library built on Linux, as they use different ABIs.

- en: '`#[repr(Rust)]`. But if there is data that needs to pass through an FFI boundary,
    the accepted standard is to use the data layout of C (annotated as `#[repr(C)]`
    ). In this layout, the order, size, and alignment of fields are as it is done
    in C programs. This is important to ensure the compatibility of data across the
    FFI boundary.'

- en: Rust guarantees that if the `#[repr(C)]` attribute is applied to a struct, the
    layout of the struct will be compatible with the platform's representation in
    C. There are automated tools, such as `cbindgen`, that can help generate the C
    data layout from Rust programs.

    `my_library` in order to resolve the symbols. It instructs the Rust compiler how
    to link to native libraries. This annotation can also be used to specify the kind
    of library to link to (*static* or *dynamic*). The following annotation tells
    `rustc` to link to a *static* library with the name `my_other_library`:'

    looked at how to specify instructions to the compiler and linker through various
    annotations in code, for aspects such as the target platform, operating system,
    data layout, and link instructions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we reviewed the basics of unsafe Rust and understood the key
    differences between safe and unsafe Rust. We saw how unsafe Rust enables us to
    perform operations that would not be allowed in safe Rust, such as dereferencing
    raw pointers, accessing or mutating static variables, working with unions, implementing
    unsafe traits, and calling external functions. We also looked at what a foreign
    function interface is, and how to write one in Rust. We wrote an example of invoking
    a C function from Rust. Also, in the example project, we wrote a Rust shared library
    and invoked it from a C program. We saw guidelines for how to write safe FFIs
    in Rust. We took a look at the ABI and annotations that can be used to specify
    conditional compilation, data layout, and link options.
