<p>Welcome. The aim of this book is to teach beginner and moderate Rust programmers how to exploit modern parallel machines in the Rust programming language. This book will contain a variety of information relevant specifically to the Rust programming language, especially with regard to its standard library, but it will also contain information that is more generally applicable but happens to be expressed in Rust. Rust itself is<span> </span><em>not</em><span> </span>a terribly inventive language. Its key contribution, from where I sit, is the mainstreaming of affine types with application to memory allocation tracking. In most other respects, it is a familiar systems programming language, one that ought to feel familiar—with a bit of adjustment—to those with a background in GC-less programming languages. This is a good thing, considering our aim here is to investigate concurrency—there is a wealth of information available in the papers and books written about this subject, and we understand and apply their concepts. This book will reference a number of such works, whose contexts are C++ , ATS, ADA, and similar <span>languages</span>.</p>

<p><span>If this is your first Rust programming book, I warmly thank you for your enthusiasm, but encourage you to seek out a suitable introduction to the programming language. This book will hit the ground running, and it will likely not be appropriate if you've got questions about the basics. The Rust community has produced</span><span> </span><em>excellent</em><span> </span><span>documentation, including introductory texts.</span><span> </span>The Book<span> </span><span>(</span><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/">https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/</a><span>), first edition, is how many who are already in the community learned the language. The second edition of the book, still in progress at the time of writing, looks to be an improvement over the original text, and it is also recommended. There are many other excellent introductions widely available for purchase, as well.</span></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This book covers a deep topic in a relatively short space. Throughout the text, the reader is expected to be comfortable with the Rust programming language, have access to a Rust compiler and a computer on which to compile, and execute Rust programs. What additional software appears in this book is covered in <a href="5f3aec9d-fd53-48ff-9ba8-43ce13e91cff.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Preliminaries – Machine Architecture and Getting Started with Rust</em>, and it is recommended for use but not mandatory. </p>
<p>The basic premise of this book is as follows—parallel programming is difficult but not impossible. Parallel programming can be done, and done well, when attention is paid to the computing environment and care is put into the validation of the produced program. To that end, each chapter has been written with an eye toward imparting a solid foundation to the reader of the chapter's subject. Once a chapter is digested, the reader will, hopefully, have a solid path into the existing body of literature on that subject. In that, this is a book of beginnings, not ends. </p>
<p>I strongly encourage the reader to take an active role in reading this book, download the source code, investigate the projects as you read through independent of the book's take, and probe the running programs with the tools available on your operating system. Like anything else, parallel programming ability is a skill that is acquired and honed by practice. </p>
<p>One final note—allow the process of learning to proceed at its own pace. If one chapter's subject doesn't immediately settle in your mind, that's okay. For me, the process of writing the book was a confluence of flashes of insight and knowledge that unfolded slowly like a flower. I imagine that the process of reading the book will proceed analogously. </p>
