The compiler carefully checks all uses of variables and pointers so that common problems from C / C++ and other languages, such as pointers to wrong memory locations or null references, are a thing of the past. Potential problems are detected at compilation time so that Rust programs execute at speeds that are comparable with their C++ counterparts.</p><p>Rust runs with a very light runtime, which does not perform garbage collection. Again the compiler takes care of generating code that frees all resources at the right time. This means Rust can run in very constrained environments, such as embedded or real-time systems. When executing code concurrently no data races can occur, because the compiler imposes the same memory safety restrictions as when the code executes consecutively.</p><p>From the preceding description, it is clear that Rust is applicable in all use cases where C and C++ were the preferred languages until now and that it will do a better job.</p><p>Rust is a very rich language; it has concepts (such as immutability by default) and constructs (such as traits) that enable developers to write code in a highly functional and object-oriented style.</p><p>The original goal of Rust was to serve as the language to write a new safe browser engine that was devoid of the many security flaws that plague existing browsers. This is the Servo project from Mozilla Research.</p><p>The goal of this book is to give you a firm foundation so that you can start to develop in Rust. Throughout the book, we emphasize the three pillars of Rust: safety, performance, and concurrency. We discuss the areas and the reasons why Rust differs from other programming languages. The code examples are not chosen ad hoc, but they are oriented as part of an ongoing project to build a game so that there is a sense of cohesion and evolution in the examples.</p><p>Throughout the book, I will urge you to learn by doing things; you can follow along by typing in the code, making the requested modifications, compiling, testing, and working out the exercises.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 1. Starting with Rust" href="part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S1">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Starting with Rust</em></span>, discusses the main reasons that led to the development of Rust. We compare Rust with other languages and indicate the areas in which it is most appropriate. Then, we guide you through the installation of all the necessary components for Rust's development environment.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 2. Using Variables and Types" href="part0023.xhtml#aid-LTSU1">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Variables and Types</em></span>, looks at the basic structure of a Rust program. We discuss the primitive types, how to declare variables and whether they have to be typed, and the scope of variables. Immutability, which is one of the key cornerstones of Rust's safety strategy, is also illustrated. Then, we look at basic operations, how to do formatted printing, and the important difference between expressions and statements.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 3. Using Functions and Control Structures" href="part0032.xhtml#aid-UGI01">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Functions and Control Structures</em></span>, shows you how to define functions and the different ways to influence program execution flow in Rust.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 4. Structuring Data and Matching Patterns" href="part0038.xhtml#aid-147LC2">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Structuring Data and Matching Patterns</em></span>, discusses the basic data types for programming, such as strings, vectors, slices, tuples, and enums. Then, we show you the powerful pattern matching that is possible in Rust and how values are extracted by de-structuring patterns.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 5. Generalizing Code with Higher-order Functions and Parametrization" href="part0046.xhtml#aid-1BRPS1">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Generalizing Code with Higher-order Functions and Parametrization</em></span>, explores the functional and object-oriented features of Rust. You will see how data structures and functions can be defined in a generic way and how traits can be used to define behavior.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 6. Pointers and Memory Safety" href="part0056.xhtml#aid-1LCVG2">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Pointers and Memory Safety</em></span>, exposes the borrow checker, which is Rust's mechanism to ensure that only memory safe operations can occur. We discuss different kinds of pointers as well as how to handle runtime errors.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 7. Organizing Code and Macros" href="part0062.xhtml#aid-1R42S2">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Organizing Code and Macros</em></span>, discusses the bigger code-organizing structures in Rust. We will also touch upon how to build macros in order to generate code and save time and effort.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 8. Concurrency and Parallelism" href="part0065.xhtml#aid-1TVKI2">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Concurrency and Parallelism</em></span>, delves into Rust's concurrency model with its basic concepts of threads and channels. We also discuss a safe strategy for working with shared mutable data.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 9. Programming at the Boundaries" href="part0069.xhtml#aid-21PMQ1">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Programming at the Boundaries</em></span>, looks at how Rust can take command-line parameters to process. Then, we go on to look at situations where we have to leave the safety boundaries, such as when we interface with C or use raw pointers, and how Rust minimizes potential dangers when we do so.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Appendix A. Exploring Further" href="part0075.xhtml#aid-27GQ61">Appendix</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Exploring Further</em></span>, talks about the Rust ecosystem and where the reader can find more information about certain topics, such as working with files, databases, games, and web development.</p></div></div>

This also contains the Cargo project and the package manager. To work more comfortably with the Rust code, a development environment such as Sublime Text can also be of use. <a class="link" title="Chapter 1. Starting with Rust" href="part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S1">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Starting with Rust</em></span>, contains detailed instructions on how to set up your Rust environment.</p></div>
