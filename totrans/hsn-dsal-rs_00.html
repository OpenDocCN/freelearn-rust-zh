                    <h1 class="header-title">Preface</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When I first made the effort of learning one programming language a year, I started with Ruby, then learned a bit of Scala, until, in 2015, I started with a very new language: Rust. My first attempts at creating a Slack (a team chat program) bot were somewhat successful but very frustrating. Being used to Python's flexibility with JSON data and permissive compiler, Rust's steep learning curve quickly took its toll.</p>
<p>The next projects were more successful. A database driver, as well as my very own <strong>Internet of Things</strong> (<strong>IoT</strong>)-type client and server application for the Raspberry Pi, allowed me to collect temperature data in a rock-solid manner. Unlike Python, if the program compiled, it would almost certainly work as expected—and I loved it.</p>
<p>Since then, a lot has changed. Big companies such as Microsoft and Amazon are picking up Rust as a way to create safe and fast code on embedded devices as well as in the cloud. With <strong>WebAssembly</strong> (<strong>Wasm</strong>), Rust is gaining traction in the web frontend space, and gaming companies are starting to build game engines in Rust. 2018 has been a great year for the technology and the Rust community, both of which will continue to grow in 2019 (and beyond).</p>
<p>For this reason, I hope to provide a learning resource for creating more sophisticated Rust code from a practical angle. Wherever your journey leads you, learning about Rust and its various programming models will change your view of code for the better.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Who this book is for</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Rust has great tutorials for learning the fundamentals of the language. There are workshops at every conference, regular meetups in many cities, and a very helpful online community. However, many developers find themselves beyond these resources but still don't feel ready for more complex solutions. Especially coming from different backgrounds with years of experience, the transition can be daunting: examples on the one side feature some type of a "Hello World!" program; on the other side, there are huge Rust open source projects with thousands of lines of code – impossible to learn from quickly. If you feel like this, then this book is for you.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What this book covers</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><a href="e07bf37e-f255-42ef-abbb-9f141dc5be61.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Hello Rust!</em>, gives a short recap of the Rust programming language and what changed in the 2018 edition.</p>
<p><a href="c6ebe545-0fc3-42fe-adf2-3a8d8fe3d501.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Cargo and Crates</em>, discusses Rust's <kbd>cargo</kbd> build tool. We will explore the configuration as well as the build process and modularization options.</p>
<p><a href="804d0af9-4267-4e94-a082-505ce23d8633.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Storing Efficiently</em>, looks at how in Rust, knowing where values are stored is not only important for performance, but also important for understanding error messages and the language in general. In this chapter, we think about stack and heap memory.  </p>
<p><a href="1a6971bb-ec24-47d5-b44c-cfb4da7d5b24.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Lists, Lists, and More Lists</em>, covers the first data structures: lists. Using several examples, this chapter goes into variations of sequential data structures and their implementations.</p>
<p><a href="84f203ac-a9f6-498b-90ff-e069c41aaca0.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Robust Trees</em>, continues our journey through popular data structures: trees are next on the list. In several detailed examples, we explore the inner workings of these efficient designs and how they improve application performance considerably. </p>
<p><a href="95653045-6e1c-4ef7-bd0c-8e45b1ccfa1d.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Exploring Maps and Sets</em>, explores the most popular key-value stores: maps. In this chapter, techniques surrounding hash maps; hashing; and their close relative, the set; are described in detail. </p>
<p><a href="ba6dfa3b-1b5c-4033-a641-da15b9adb390.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Collections in Rust</em>, attempts to connect to the Rust programmer's daily life, going into the details of the Rust <kbd>std::collections</kbd> library, which contains the various data structures provided by the Rust standard library.</p>
<p><a href="6ab96dc6-b8f5-4c03-88a3-f4a345f8cc9b.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Algorithm Evaluation</em>, teaches you how to evaluate and compare algorithms. </p>
<p><a href="a9ba9f9e-59a2-411f-8998-831fe4e69266.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Ordering Things</em>, will look at sorting values, an important task in programming—this chapter uncovers how that can be done quickly and safely.</p>
<p><a href="32002bad-c2bb-46e9-918d-12d7dabfe579.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Finding Stuff</em>, moves onto searching, which is especially important if there is no fundamental data structure to support it. In these cases, we use algorithms to be able to quickly find what we are looking for. </p>
<p><a href="0131b10b-0ea4-4663-966a-46d6ecda142b.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Random and Combinatorial</em>, is where we will see that, outside of sorting and searching, there are many problems that can be tackled algorithmically. This chapter is all about those: random number generation, backtracking, and improving computational complexities.</p>
<p><a href="04e371f3-13fa-4c73-9329-8074a080785a.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Algorithms of the Standard Library</em>, explores how the Rust standard library does things when it comes to everyday algorithmic tasks such as sorting and searching.</p>

<p>This book comes with a lot of code examples and implementations. For you to learn the most that you can, it is recommended to install Rust (any version later than 1.33 should do) and run all of the examples. Here are a few recommendations for text editors and other tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>), arguably one of the best Rust code editors</li>
<li>Rust support for Visual Studio Code via a plugin (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rls-vscode">https://github.com/rust-lang/rls-vscode</a>) </li>
<li><strong>Rust Language Server</strong> (<strong>RLS</strong>), found at <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rls-vscode">https://github.com/rust-lang/rls-vscode</a>, installed via <kbd>rustup</kbd> (<a href="https://rustup.rs/">https://rustup.rs/</a>)</li>
<li>Debugging support using the LLDB frontend plugin (<a href="https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb">https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb</a>) for Visual Studio Code</li>
</ul>
<p>Having this environment set up and being familiar with it is great for your daily Rust programming, and will let you debug and inspect the workings of the code provided in this book. For you to get the most out of this book, we recommend that you do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the source code in the repository to get the whole picture. The snippets are only isolated examples to show specifics.</li>
<li>Don't blindly trust our results; run the tests and benchmarks of each sub-project (chapters) to reproduce the findings yourself.</li>
</ul>
