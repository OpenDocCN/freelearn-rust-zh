<p>Several years ago, I set out learning a new programming language every year – as many programmers do. There are many paradigms, rules, and insights to be gained from knowing another programming language, and then I found Rust. Rust turned out to be too much fun to write to simply move on, and after the steep learning curve, it became even more fun. So, there I had it: having learned a total of two additional (TypeScript and Rust) languages, I stuck to Rust. Why? Let's find out.</p>
<p>Rust is a systems programming language that provides memory safety by default without a garbage collector, which impacts its runtime behavior. Regardless of this fact, Rust is a very versatile language that can be used across various domains, be it web programming, game engines, or web clients. Moreover, it challenges conventional thinking about scopes and memory allocation, making you a better programmer in any language, be it C#, Java, or Python. The latest push on the part of companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google shows that the ecosystem has now evolved to a point where things are stabilizing enough for enterprise usage – a great sign for a future Rust professional. </p>
<p>In this book, we have compiled the most useful experiments with sensible use cases to make you productive fast. We have tried to cover a wide range of applications and hope you find useful concepts as well as solutions that are <span>directly applicable </span>to your daily development work. </p>

<p><span><span>This book is not your typical book to learn a programming language. Instead of diving deep into concepts, we want to show a range of possible projects, solutions, and applications that provide further links to concepts and other resources. Thus, we think this book is for anyone looking to get into practical applications quickly – regardless of their Rust experience. However, programming fundamentals (in any language) are required – they are the fundamental base your Rust skills will rest on. </span></span></p>

<p><a href="c6b2f137-b846-48cc-a378-5c2fccce4114.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Starting off with Rust</em>, covers<span> how to set up Rust toolchains on your computer and the fundamental constructs of the language. These range from writing tests and benchmarks to language constructs such as loops, <kbd>if</kbd> expressions, traits, and structs.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><a href="db0ca1d0-05a4-4bb9-b10a-8511b78e22c9.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Going Further with Advanced Rust</em>, <span>answers questions about more in-depth features of the language as well as patterns for creating meaningful programs. Topics include borrowing and ownership in complex scenarios, the <kbd>Option</kbd> type, pattern matching, generics, explicit lifetimes, and enums.</span></p>
<p><a href="cdcbf36d-9343-4b7b-ace1-b4c570dab62c.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Managing Projects with Cargo</em>, <span>uses the <kbd>cargo</kbd> tool to manage additional crates, extensions, projects, and tests. You will find recipes that empower you to work on larger projects and solve challenges faced in managing them.</span></p>
<p><a href="eb7f566a-00ca-4e6c-bc05-4e9d00bf8c56.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Fearless Concurrency</em>, <span>goes into some best practices and recipes to build safe, fast programs. </span><span>In addition to this, popular libraries such as Rayon are presented as we demonstrate that Rust is a great language for doing all kinds of concurrent tasks. </span></p>
<p><a href="898e8c94-b6e0-41d4-a06a-6fd95fb88466.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Handling Errors and Other Results</em>, explains how <span>Rust uses the </span><span><kbd>Result</kbd> </span><span>type and panics to perform error handling, integrating most failure cases into a regular workflow that needs to be treated.</span><span> This chapter shows applicable patterns and best practices around avoiding unexpected crashes and unnecessary complexity.</span></p>
<p><a href="a8fae7de-6021-4d6e-9c75-e24288bc92e7.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Expressing Yourself with Macros</em>, explains how <span>Rust'</span><span>s unique macro system extends the functionality of programs before compilation—in a type safe way. These macros can be implemented for many possible custom scenarios, and many crates use this ability.</span><span> This chapter is all about creating useful macros to make your life easier and your programs safer.</span></p>
<p><a href="ccc55197-effc-4a8a-833f-c8a5607d06d5.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Integrating Rust with Other Languages,</em> u<span>ses and works with different binary units and languages from within Rust in order to port legacy software or benefit from better SDKs. This is realized mostly through the <strong>Foreign Function Interface</strong> (<strong>FFI</strong>), which enables quick and easy integration with other native binaries. On top of that, it is possible to publish to <kbd>npm</kbd> (the Node.js package repository) from Rust using WebAssembly. These and other things are discussed in this chapter.</span></p>
<p><a href="e90b9507-b016-4a88-aefa-54e710617d96.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Safe Programming for the Web</em>, <span>uses a state-of-the-art web framework to show the fundamentals of web programming – <kbd>actix-web</kbd>, which showcases an actor-based approach to handling requests, in productive use at Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><a href="d229ae85-1922-45fc-ab87-b1de7a533f9b.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Systems Programming Made Easy</em>, explains how <span>Rust is a great choice for running workloads on small devices with limited resources. In particular, the lack of a garbage collector and the resulting predictable runtime makes it a great fit for running sensor data collectors. Creating such a loop together with the required driver to read data is what we cover in this chapter.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><a href="56122c90-cffc-4114-80a2-c86fbb924eb4.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Getting Practical with Rust</em>, covers p<span>ractical considerations in Rust programming, such as parsing command-line arguments, working with neural networks (machine learning with PyTorch's C++ API), searching, regular expressions, web requests, and much more.</span></p>

<p>We consider a few things in terms of programming fundamentals and we assume that you are familiar with these concepts already. Here is a list of terms you should be able to explain in a programming context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types and enums</li>
<li>Control statements and execution flow</li>
<li>Program architectures and patterns</li>
<li>Streams and iterators</li>
<li>Linking</li>
<li>Generics</li>
</ul>
<p>Equipped with this knowledge, you can dive in with an editor of your choice (we recommend Visual Studio Code (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">https://code.visualstudio.com</a>), together with the official Rust extension (<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust</a>)). While Rust is a cross-platform programming language, some recipes are significantly easier on Linux or macOS. Windows users are encouraged to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10</a>) for a better experience. </p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Mount the downloaded <kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd> disk image file as another disk in your system."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>macro_rules! strange_patterns {<br/>    (The pattern must match precisely) =&gt; { "Text" };<br/>    (42) =&gt; { "Numeric" };<br/>    (;&lt;=,&lt;=;) =&gt; { "Alpha" };<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>#[test]<br/>#[should_panic]<br/><strong>fn test_failing_make_fn() {</strong><br/>    make_fn!(fail, {assert!(false)});<br/>    fail();<br/> } </pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ cargo run</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
