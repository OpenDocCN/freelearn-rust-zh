			<p>The Rust programming language has held the "most-loved" technology ranking on Stack Overflow for 6 years running, while JavaScript has been the most-used programming language for 9 years straight, as it runs on every web browser (<a href="https://bit.ly/3JBg4ms">https://bit.ly/3JBg4ms</a>). Now, thanks to WebAssembly (or Wasm), you can use the language you love on a platform that's everywhere. This book is an easy-to-follow reference to help you develop your own games, teaching you all about game development and how to create an endless runner from scratch. You'll begin by drawing simple graphics in the browser window, and then learn how to move the main character across the screen. You'll also create a game loop, a renderer, and more, all written entirely in Rust. After getting simple shapes onto the screen, you'll scale the challenge by adding sprites, sounds, and user input. As you advance, you'll discover how to implement a procedurally generated world and add sound effects and music. Finally, you'll learn how to keep your Rust code clean and organized so that you can continue to implement new features and deploy your app on the web. By the end of this Rust programming book, you'll have built a 2D game in Rust, deployed it to the web, and be confident enough to start building your own games.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This game development book is for developers interested in Rust who want to create and deploy 2D games to the web. Game developers looking to build a game on a web platform using WebAssembly without C++ programming or web developers who want to explore WebAssembly along with JavaScript web will also find this book useful. The book will also help Rust developers who want to move from the server side to the client side by familiarizing them with the WebAssembly toolchain. Some knowledge of Rust programming is assumed, but you do not need to be an expert.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B17151_01_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Hello WebAssembly</em>, sets up your first WebAssembly project, explains the toolchain, and runs an application in the browser, drawing to the HTML Canvas that we'll be using throughout this book.</p>
			<p><a href="B17151_02_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>,<em class="italic"> Drawing Sprites</em>, introduces you to our main character, Red Hat Boy, by showing you how to render a <code>.png</code> file to the screen. Then, we'll make Red Hat Boy run with animation and a sprite sheet.</p>
			<p><a href="B17151_03_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor063"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating a Game Loop</em>, introduces a very basic game engine, so that we can move our character all around the screen at 60 frames per second.</p>
			<p><a href="B17151_04_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor093"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Animations with State Machines</em>, describes how to make Red Hat Boy run, slide, and jump with state machines and the Rust typestate pattern.</p>
			<p><a href="B17151_05_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor114"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Collision Detection</em>, starts to make the game fun, making Red Hat Boy crash into and jump over obstacles. We'll introduce axis-aligned bounding boxes and tweak them to account for transparency. </p>
			<p><a href="B17151_06_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor139"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating an Endless Runner</em>, takes the game from one scene into a scene where Red Hat Boy runs to the right, jumping procedurally generated obstacles and platforms that continue for as long as you can keep playing.</p>
			<p><a href="B17151_07_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor166"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Sound Effects and Music</em>, shows us how to use the Web Audio API to get real immersion into the game with sound effects and catchy music.</p>
			<p><a href="B17151_08_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor185"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Adding a UI</em>, integrates HTML with the canvas to create a UI, restructuring the game to make it fit.</p>
			<p><a href="B17151_09_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Testing, Debugging, and Performance</em>, helps us write some automated tests for the game and investigates performance with the browser tools.</p>
			<p><a href="B17151_10_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor226"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Continuous Deployment</em>, deploys our game to the web so that anybody can play!</p>
			<p><a href="B17151_11_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor236"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Further Resources and What's Next?</em>, takes us through what to do next for bigger, more ambitious games.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>This book expects you to have a rudimentary understanding of Rust and doesn't cover the syntax. It doesn't expect you to be an expert; you won't be writing any macros or complicated traits, so even a Rust cheat sheet should be enough. The book is structured as a tutorial and is best worked through beginning to end. </p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Conventions used</h1>
			<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
			<p><code>Code in text</code>: This indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: "Cypress performs most of its API tests via the <code>cy.request()</code> method, which serves as a <code>GET</code> command to the web server being tested."</p>
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<pre>enum RedHatBoyState {
    Jumping,
    Running,
    Sliding,
}</pre>
			<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
			<pre>impl RedHatBoyContext {
        pub fn update(mut self, frame_count: u8) -&gt; 
        Self {
        ...
        self.position.x += self.velocity.x;
        self.position.y += self.velocity.y;
        <strong class="bold">if self.position.y &gt; FLOOR {</strong>
            <strong class="bold">self.position.y = FLOOR;</strong>
        <strong class="bold">}</strong></pre>
			<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
			<pre>the trait `From&lt;SlidingEndState&gt;` is not implemented for `RedHatBoyStateMachine`</pre>
			<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: This indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen – for instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: "Upon any test launch from the GUI, users will have the ability to click on the <strong class="bold">Add New Test</strong> button."</p>
