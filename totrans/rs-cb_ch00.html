<p>Rust is a system programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. If you are building concurrent applications, server-side programs, or high-performance applications, you will benefit from this language. This book comes with a lot of application-specific recipes to kick-start your developing real-world, high-performance applications with the Rust programming language and integrating Rust units into your existing applications. In this book, you will find over 85 practical recipes written in Rust that will allow you to use the code samples in your existing applications right away.</p>
<p>This book will help you understand the core concepts of the Rust language, enabling you to develop efficient and high-performance applications by incorporating features such as zero cost abstraction and better memory management. We'll delve into advanced-level concepts such as error handling, macros, crates, and parallelism in Rust. Toward the end of the book, you will learn how to create HTTP servers and web services, building a strong foundational knowledge in server-side programming and enabling you to deliver solutions to build high-performance and safer production-level web applications and services using Rust.</p>

<p class="mce-root">In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning. Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "A few other commands with the <kbd>rustup.sh</kbd> script are as follows."</p>
<p class="mce-root">A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px"> fn main() {<br/>     println!("Welcome to Rust Cookbook");<br/>  }

<p class="mce-root"><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">In macOS, you can open the Terminal by pressing the <em>F4</em> key, which opens the launchpad and searches for the Terminal. Then, you can select the Terminal option in the display. This is just one possible way of doing it; there are other ways too.<br/>
In Linux distributions, we can jointly press <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Alt</em> + <em>T</em> to open the Terminal or search for it in the application search window.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">It's considered good style to put the opening curly brace on the same line as the function declaration, with one space in between.</div>
