- en: Rust is a new programming language. It offers performance and safety that is
    equivalent to, or even surpasses, modern C++ while being a modern language with
    a relatively low barrier to entry. Rust's momentum, combined with its active and
    friendly community, promise a great future for the language.

- en: While modern and fluent, Rust is not a particularly easy language. The memory
    management system keeps track of the life of every entity that is used in your
    program and is designed in such a way that this tracking can typically happen
    entirely at compile time. The Rust programmer's burden is to help the compiler
    when it cannot decide for itself what should happen. Since modern programming
    is possible without ever facing such responsibilities, a modern programmer may
    not immediately feel comfortable with Rust.

    more valuable it is, and this book is here to help you. This book covers the basics
    of Rust, enabling you to gain enough skills to start programming with it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To really dive into the content of this book, you should write out the example
    code and do the exercises. For that, you'll need a fairly recent computer; a gigabyte
    of RAM should be enough for the purposes of this book, but the more you have the
    faster the builds will be.

    citizen on macOS and recent versions of Windows, so all the examples should adapt
