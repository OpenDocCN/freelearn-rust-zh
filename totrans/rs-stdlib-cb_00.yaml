- en: Mozilla's Rust is slowly gaining attention, with amazing features and a powerful
    library. This book will take you through varied recipes that will teach you how
    to leverage the standard library to implement efficient solutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book begins with a brief look at the basic modules of the standard library
    and collections. From there, the recipes will cover crates, which support file/directory
    handling and (de)serialization for the most common data formats. You will learn
    about crates related to advanced data structures, error handling, and networking.
    You will also learn to work with futures and experimental nightly features. The
    book also covers the most relevant external crates in Rust. You will be able to
    compose your own algorithms using the standard modules of the library.

    and rustc 1.26.0-nightly; however, Rust's strong backward compatibility should
    make it possible for you to use any newer versions for all chapters except the
    last. [Chapter 10](f2c7ca21-145e-40af-8502-8b42b37fe290.xhtml)*, Using Experimental

- en: An active internet connection is required for many recipes, as we will work
    intensively with crates. These are Rust's way of distributing libraries over the
    internet, and they are hosted at [https://crates.io/](https://crates.io/).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might wonder why a book about Rust's standard library, or std for short,
    uses so much code from outside the std. That's because Rust, in contrast to most
    other system languages, was designed with strong dependency management in mind
    from the beginning. It's so easy to pull crates into your code that a lot of specific
    functionality has been outsourced to officially recommended crates. This helps
    the core standard library that is distributed with Rust to stay simple and very
    stable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most official group of crates after the std is the *nursery* ([https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery?language=rust](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery?language=rust)).
    These crates are the standard for many operations and are nearly stable or generic
    enough to be in the std.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we can't find a crate for a recipe in the nursery, we look at the crates
    of the Rust core team members ([https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/people](https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/people)),
    who put a lot of effort into providing functionality that is missing from the
    standard library. These crates are not in the nursery because they are usually
    specific enough that it is not worth allocating too many resources to actively
    maintaining them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All the code in this book has been formatted with the newest rustfmt (rustfmt-nightly
    v0.4.0), which you can optionally download using rustup component add rustfmt-preview
    and run with cargo fmt. The code on GitHub ([https://github.com/jnferner/rust-standard-library-cookbook](https://github.com/jnferner/rust-standard-library-cookbook))
    is going to be actively maintained and consequently formatted using a newer version
    of rustfmt, if available. In some cases, this means that the source code line
    markings can become outdated. It should not be hard to find the code, however,
    as this shift is usually no greater than two or three lines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All code has also been checked by Rust's official linter, clippy ([https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy)),
    using version 0.0.187\. If you want, you can install it with cargo +nightly install
    clippy and run it with cargo +nightly clippy. The newest version tends to break
    quite often though, so don't be surprised if it doesn't work outright.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some clippy and rustc warnings have been left in the code intentionally. Most
    of these are either dead code, which happens when we assign a value to a variable
    to illustrate a concept and then don't need to use the variable anymore, or usage
    of placeholder names such as foo, bar, or baz, which are used when the exact purpose
    of a variable is irrelevant to the recipe.
