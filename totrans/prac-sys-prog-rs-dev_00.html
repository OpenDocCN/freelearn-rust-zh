			<p>The modern software stack is evolving rapidly in size and complexity. Technology domains such as the cloud, the web, data science, machine learning, DevOps, containers, IoT, embedded systems, distributed ledgers, virtual and augmented reality, and artificial intelligence continue to evolve and specialize. This has resulted in a severe shortage of system software developers able to build out the system infrastructure components. Modern societies, businesses, and governments increasingly rely heavily on digital technologies, which puts greater emphasis on developing safe, reliable, and efficient systems software and software infrastructure that modern web and mobile applications are built on.</p>
			<p>System programming languages such as C/C++ have proved their mettle for decades in this domain, and provide a high degree of control and performance, but it is at the cost of memory safety.</p>
			<p>Higher-level languages such as Java, C#, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript provide memory safety but offer less control over memory layout, and suffer from garbage collection pauses.</p>
			<p>Rust is a modern, open source system programming language that promises the best of three worlds: the type safety of Java; the speed, expressiveness, and efficiency of C++; and memory safety without a garbage collector.</p>
			<p>This book adopts a unique three-step approach to teaching system programming in Rust. Each chapter in this book starts with an overview of the system programming fundamentals and kernel system calls for that topic in Unix-like operating systems (Unix/Linux/macOS). You will then learn how to perform common system calls using the Rust Standard Library, and in a few cases, external crates, using abundant code snippets. This knowledge is then reinforced through a practical example project that you will build. Lastly, there are questions in each chapter to embed learning.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will have a sound foundational understanding of how to use Rust to manage and control operating system resources such as memory, files, processes, threads, system environment, peripheral devices, networking interfaces, terminals, and shells, and you'll understand how to build cross-language bindings through FFI. Along the way, you will learn how to use the tools of the trade, and get a firm appreciation of the value Rust brings to build safe, performant, reliable, and efficient system-level software.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is aimed at programmers with basic knowledge of Rust but little or no system programming or experience. This book is also for people who have a background in system programming and want to consider Rust as an alternative to C/C++.</p>
			<p>The reader should have a basic understanding of programming concepts in any language, such as C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, or Go.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>Rustup must be installed in your local development environment. Use this link for installation: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup">https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup</a>.</p>
			<p>Refer to the following link for official installation instructions: <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install</a>.</p>
			<p>After installation, check whether <code>rustc</code>, and <code>cargo</code> have been installed correctly with the following commands:</p>
			<pre>rustc --version 
cargo –version</pre>
			<p>You can use Linux, macOS, or Windows.</p>
			<p>While the Rust standard library largely is platform-independent, the general flavor of the book is oriented towards Linux/Unix-based systems. As a result, in a few chapters (or some sections within chapters) it is recommended to use a local Linux virtual machine, like Virtual box, (or if you have a cloud VM you may use it) for the code in the chapter to work. This may be because a command, or an external crate or a shared library used in example code and projects may be Linux/Unix specific.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note for those using Windows for development</p>
			<p class="callout">There are certain chapters that require a virtual machine or Docker image running Unix-like OSes (Unix/Linux/macOS).</p>
			<p>There are two types of code in each chapter which are placed in the Packt GitHub repository for the book:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The code corresponding to the example projects (which are referred to by named source files within the chapter),</li>
				<li>Independent code snippets, that are placed within the <code>miscellaneous</code> folder within each chapter (where applicable)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access the code via the GitHub repository (link available in the next section). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting of code.</p>
			<p>While using <code>cargo run</code> command to build and run Rust programs, you may encounter 'permission denied' messages if the user ID with which the command is run does not have sufficient permissions to perform system-level operations (such as reading or writing to files). In such cases, one of the workarounds that can be used is to run the program with the following command:</p>
			<pre>sudo env "PATH=$PATH" cargo run</pre>

			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The code snippets in this book are designed for learning, and not intended to be of production quality. As a result, while the code examples are practical and use idiomatic Rust, they are not likely to be full-featured with robust error handling covering all types of edge cases. This is by design, so as not to impede the learning process.</p>
