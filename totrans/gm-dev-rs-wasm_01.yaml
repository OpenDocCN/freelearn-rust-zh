- en: In this part, you'll build the skeleton for the application you'll be using
    for the rest of this book. You'll create your first WebAssembly app using Rust,
    and interact with JavaScript using `wasm-bindgen`. You'll also get started drawing
    to the Canvas, first with crude shapes and then with Sprites (image files) and
    even sprite sheets.
