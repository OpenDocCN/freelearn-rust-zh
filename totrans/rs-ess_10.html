In this book, we did not discuss each and every concept of Rust, and also not in every detail. Here, we will talk about what has been left out and where the reader can find more information or details about the topics.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec69"/>Stability of Rust and the standard library</h1></div></div></div><p>The Rust 1.0 production <a id="id313" class="indexterm"/>version comes with a commitment for stability; if your code compiles on Rust stable 1.0, it will compile with Rust stable 1.x with no or minimal changes.</p><p>The development <a id="id314" class="indexterm"/>of Rust follows a train model with three release channels (nightly, beta, and stable), and every six weeks a new stable release will take place. Production users will prefer to stick with the stable branch. Every six weeks, a new beta version is published; this excludes all unstable code, so you know that if you are using beta or stable, your code will continue to compile. Simultaneously, the existing beta branch is promoted to be a stable release. The nightly channel is what you use if you want the latest changes and additions; it includes unstable features and libraries that may still change in backwards incompatible ways.</p><p>The vast majority <a id="id315" class="indexterm"/>of functionality in the standard library is now stable. For in-depth information, refer to<a id="id316" class="indexterm"/> the documentation at <a class="ulink" href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/">http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/</a>.</p></div></div>

<strong>Application Programming Interfaces</strong> (<strong>APIs</strong>) out of the language and the standard library and into their own crates. An ever-growing ecosystem of crates for Rust is at your<a id="id319" class="indexterm"/> disposal at <a class="ulink" href="https://crates.io/">https://crates.io/</a>, with over 2,000 crates in stock at the time of writing (May 2015).</p><p>At <em>Awesome Rust</em> (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/kud1ing/awesome-rust">https://github.com/kud1ing/awesome-rust</a>), you can find a curated list of Rust <a id="id320" class="indexterm"/>projects. This site only contains useful and stable projects and indicates whether they compile in the latest Rust version. In addition, it is worth to search <a id="id321" class="indexterm"/>
<em>Rust Kit</em> (<a class="ulink" href="http://rustkit.io/">http://rustkit.io/</a>), as well as the<a id="id322" class="indexterm"/> Rust-CI repository at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.rust-ci.org/projects/">http://www.rust-ci.org/projects/</a>.</p><p>In general, it is <a id="id323" class="indexterm"/>advisable that you search for crates that are already available whenever you embark on a project that requires specific functionality. There is a good chance that a crate that conforms to your needs already exists, or perhaps, you can find some usable starting code upon which you can build what you exactly need.</p></div>

The most advanced and stable crate for developing HTTP applications at this moment is hyper. It is fast and contains both an HTTP client and a server to build complex web applications. To get started with it, read the introductory article at <a class="ulink" href="https://siciarz.net/24-days-of-rust-hyper/">https://siciarz.net/24-days-of-rust-hyper/</a>.</p><p>The HTTP client libraries built on top of hyper<a id="id350" class="indexterm"/> are <code class="literal">rust-request</code> and <code class="literal">rest_client</code>. A new Rust HTTP Toolkit project is emerging under the name<a id="id351" class="indexterm"/> teepee (<a class="ulink" href="http://teepee.rs/">http://teepee.rs/</a>). It looks promising, but it was in its infancy at the time of writing this book.</p><p>For web frameworks, the best usable project is iron. If you only need a light micro web framework, rustful could be your choice. If you need a<a id="id352" class="indexterm"/> <strong>Representational State Transfer</strong> (<strong>REST</strong>) framework, go for rustless. Another useful web framework, which is<a id="id353" class="indexterm"/> still under active development, is nickel (<a class="ulink" href="http://nickel.rs/">http://nickel.rs/</a>).</p><p>And of course, you must not ignore the new servo browser that is emerging!</p><p>Furthermore, crates exist for a lot of other<a id="id354" class="indexterm"/> categories such as functional and embedded programming (<a class="ulink" href="http://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/02/20/rust-language-c-embedded/">http://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/02/20/rust-language-c-embedded/</a>), data structures, image processing (the <code class="literal">image</code> crate), audio, compression, encoding and encryption (<code class="literal">rust-crypto</code> and <code class="literal">crypto</code>), regular expressions, parsing, hashing, tooling, testing, template engines, and so on. You can take a look at the Rust-CI repository or the Awesome Rust compilation; you can refer to the links in the <em>The ecosystem of crates</em> section to get an idea of what is available. Zinc (<a class="ulink" href="http://zinc.rs/">http://zinc.rs/</a>) is an<a id="id355" class="indexterm"/> example of a<a id="id356" class="indexterm"/> project that uses Rust to write a code stack for processors (at the moment, for ARM).</p><p>This brings us to the end of our Rust journey in this book. We hope you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed writing it. You now have a firm foundation to start developing using Rust. We also hope that this quick overview has shown you why Rust is a rising star in the software development world, and that you will use it in your projects. Join the Rust community and start using your coding talents. Perhaps we'll meet again in the Rust(un)iverse.</p></div></div></body></html>
