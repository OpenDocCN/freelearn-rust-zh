<p class="mce-root">This book will introduce you to the development of microservices with Rust. I started using Rust not that long ago, back in 2015. It had only been a couple of months since the release of version 1.0 and, at that time, I didn't think that this tool would usher in a silent revolution that would disrupt the traditions associated with system programming<span>, </span>which, at that time, was tedious and in no way fashionable.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm exaggerating a little, but I have witnessed how companies stopped using the customary tools and began rewriting parts of their products or a number of services in Rust, and they were so happy with the outcome that they continue to do so time and again. Today, Rust is an important part of blockchain initiatives, the flagship for WebAssembly, and is an awesome tool for developing fast and reliable microservices that utilize all available server <span>resources</span>. Consequently, Rust has transformed itself from a hobby tool for curious developers into a strong foundation for modern products.</p>
<p>In this book, we will learn how to create microservices using Rust. We begin with a short introduction to microservices, and discuss why Rust is a good tool for writing them. Then, we will create our first microservice using the <kbd>hyper</kbd> crate, and learn how to configure microservices and log activities. After that, we will explore how to support different formats of requests and responses using the <kbd>serde</kbd> crate.</p>

<p>This book is designed for two categories of reader—experienced Rust developers who are new to microservices, and advanced microservice developers who are new to Rust. I've tried to cover the ecosystem of useful tools and crates available for Rust developers today. This book describes the creation of microservices, from high-level frameworks to constructing low-level asynchronous combinators that produce responses with minimal resource blocking time. This book aims to allow you to find the solution to a specific task.</p>
<p>To be able to understand the topics covered in this book, you need a solid background in the Rust programming language (you should be able to write and compile applications using <kbd>cargo</kbd>, understand lifetimes and borrowing concepts, know how traits work, and understand how to use reference counters, mutexes, threads, and channels). If you are unfamiliar with Rust, take the time to understand these concepts before reading this book.</p>
<p>You also have to know how to write a minimal backend working on an HTTP protocol. You have to understand what REST is, and how to use it for applications. However, you don't have to understand how HTTP/2 works because we will use crates that provide abstractions agnostic to specific transport.</p>

<p><a href="f7ad26e1-b945-4ee1-ba6b-dc8fd510f4d3.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <span><em>Introduction to Microservices</em>, introduces you to microservices and how they can be created with Rust. In this chapter, we also discuss the benefits of using Rust for creating microservices.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="621dffeb-7f43-4c11-9ac5-00a366dc8d9f.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Developing a Microservice with Hyper Crate</em><span>, describes how to create microservices with the <kbd>hyper</kbd> crate, thereby allowing us to create a compact asynchronous web server with precise control over incoming requests (method, path, query parameters, and so on).<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="751f86d9-59ce-4966-beb8-cd743b521373.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <span><em>Logging and Configuring Microservices</em>, includes information about configuring a microservice using command-line arguments, environment variables, and configuration files. You will also see how to add logging to your projects, since this is the most important feature for the maintenance of microservices in production.</span></p>
<p><a href="be6bf2c7-c1dd-4d9f-b036-bbb12e1de809.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <span><em>Data Serialization and Deserialization with Serde Crate</em>, explains how, in addition to customary HTTP requests, your microservice has to support formal requests and responses in a specific format, such as JSON, and CBOR, which is important for API implementation and in terms of organizing the mutual interaction of microservices.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="ed541ef5-4701-4e70-aabf-14882b4cecb3.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="ed541ef5-4701-4e70-aabf-14882b4cecb3.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <span><em>Understanding Asynchronous Operations with Futures Crate</em>, delves into the deeper asynchronous concepts of Rust and how to use asynchronous primitives for writing combinators to process a request and prepare a response for a client. Without a clear understanding of these concepts, you cannot write effective microservices to utilize all available resources of a server, and to avoid the blocking of threads that execute asynchronous activities and require special treatment with execution runtime.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="fd4bf12a-bb05-469b-a230-163cee412261.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em><span>Reactive Microservices – Increasing Capacity and Performance</span></em><span>, introduces you to a reactive microservice that won't respond immediately to incoming requests, and that takes time to process a request and response when it's done. You will become familiar with remote procedure calls in Rust and how to use the language so that microservices can call one another.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="e09a1e76-ae09-41d4-99dc-9bad95fa3de7.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="e09a1e76-ae09-41d4-99dc-9bad95fa3de7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <span><em>Reliable Integration with Databases</em>, shows you how to interact with databases using Rust. You will get to know crates that provide interaction with databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, and DynamoDB.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="78b65084-762a-4697-b142-f47b2120e4c6.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="http://interaction"/></p>
<p><a href="78b65084-762a-4697-b142-f47b2120e4c6.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>I</em><span><em>nteraction to Database</em></span> <span><em>with Object-Relational Mapping</em>, explains how, in order to interact with SQL databases effectively and map database records to native Rust structs, you can use <strong>object-relational mapping</strong> (<strong>ORM</strong>). This chapter demonstrates how to use diesel crates which require nightly compiler version and whose capabilities are used for generating bindings with tables.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="6d371e55-d1cf-45b4-83a9-4d5098a885d0.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="6d371e55-d1cf-45b4-83a9-4d5098a885d0.xhtml"/><a href="6d371e55-d1cf-45b4-83a9-4d5098a885d0.xhtml"/><a href="6d371e55-d1cf-45b4-83a9-4d5098a885d0.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <span><em>Simple REST Definition and Request Routing with Frameworks</em>, explains how, in certain cases, you don't need to write stringent asynchronous code, and that it is sufficient to use frameworks that simplify microservice writing. In this chapter, you will become acquainted with four such frameworks—rouille, nickel, rocket, and gotham.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="ba240208-414e-4dd4-bba8-8bd2658949cd.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 10</a>, <span><em>Background Tasks and Thread Pools in Microservices</em>, discusses multithreading in microservices and how to use pools of threads to perform tasks on a background, given that not every task can be performed asynchronously and requires a high CPU load.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="5b7dd2c1-d623-4422-83a7-e05681230ee9.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="5b7dd2c1-d623-4422-83a7-e05681230ee9.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <span><em>In</em></span><em>volving Concurrency with Actors and Actix Crate</em><span>,</span> introduces you to the Actix framework, which uses the actor's model to provide you with abstractions that are easily compatible with Rust. This includes the balance of performance, the readability of the code, and task separation<span>.</span></p>
<p><a href="98204850-538d-4a2b-9a77-23f85e716400.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 12</a>, <span><em>Scalable Microservices Architecture</em>, delves into an explanation of how to design loose-coupling microservices that don't need to know about sibling microservices, and that use message queues and brokers to interact with one another. We will write an example of how to interact with other microservices using RabbitMQ.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="1d24de7f-9990-4afe-bd1c-9bf664f1eda3.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a>, <em><span>Testing and Debugging Rust Microservices</span></em><span>, explains how testing and debugging is a key component in terms of preparing for the release of microservices. You will learn how to test microservices from unit tests to cover a full application with integration tests. Afterward, we will then discuss how to debug an application using debuggers and logging capabilities. Also, we will create an example that uses distributed tracing based on the OpenTrace API – a modern tool for tracking the activities of complex applications.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="4ad99248-05f9-41c0-91c5-4c4a2582226d.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 14</a>, <span><em>Optimization of Microservices</em>, describes how to optimize a microservice and extract the maximum performance possible.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="80b8c3ec-d291-40df-a7a7-b9e9f0a64a99.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 15</a>, <span><em>Packing Servers to Containers</em>, explains how, when a microservice is ready for release, there should be a focus on packing microservices to containers, because at least some microservices require additional data and environments to work, or even just to gain the advantage of fast delivery containers over bare binaries.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="02047e73-9d47-4f12-ae3c-99d5c77daf51.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 16</a>, <span><em>DevOps of Rust Microservices - Continuous Integration and Delivery</em>, continues with the theme of learning how to build microservices and explains how to use continuous integration to automate building and delivery processes for your product.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><a href="2dceb3bc-2f03-47d9-88cd-561b4f0b50d7.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="2dceb3bc-2f03-47d9-88cd-561b4f0b50d7.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 17</a>, <span><em>Bounded Microservices with AWS Lambda</em>, introduces you to serverless architecture, an alternative approach to writing services. You will become acquainted with AWS Lambda and you can use Rust to write fast functions that work as a part of serverless applications. Also, we will use the Serverless Framework to build and deploy the example application to the AWS infrastructure in a fully automated manner.<br/></span></p>

<p>You will require at least version 1.31 of Rust. Install it using the <kbd>rustup</kbd> tool: <a href="https://rustup.rs/">https://rustup.rs/</a>. To compile examples from some chapters, you will need to install a nightly version of the compiler. Y<span>ou will also need to install Docker with Do</span><span>cker Compose to run containers with databases and message brokers to simplify the testing of example microservices from this book</span><span>.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example: </span>"Mount the downloaded <kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd> disk image file as another disk in your system."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>let conn = Connection::connect("postgres://postgres@localhost:5432", TlsMode::None).unwrap();</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]<br/>struct User {<br/><strong>    name: String,</strong><br/><strong>    email: String,</strong><br/>}</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>cargo run -- add user-1 user-1@example.com</strong><br/><strong>cargo run -- add user-2 user-2@example.com</strong><br/><strong>cargo run -- add user-3 user-3@example.com</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
