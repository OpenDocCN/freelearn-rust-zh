                    <h1 class="header-title">Preface</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This book is about Rust, a programming language that empowers you to build all kinds of software systems, ranging from low-level embedded software to dynamic web applications. Rust is fast, reliable, and safe. It offers performance and safety guarantees that reach or even surpass C and C++, while still being a modern language with a relatively low barrier of entry. Rust drive toward incremental improvements, combined with its active and friendly community, promises a great future for the language.</p>
<p>Rust is not a new language by design and doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. Rather, it's a language that has identified unique ideas, hidden away in research-prototype languages that never saw mass adoption. It brings those ideas together into a coherent composition and provides a practical language that lets you build safe software systems, while still being efficient.</p>

<p>This book targets both beginner and intermediate programmers familiar with other imperative languages, but new to Rust. It assumes that you are familiar with at least one imperative programming language, such as C, C++, or Python. Knowing about functional programming is not a requirement, but it's good to have a general idea about it. We make sure to explain any concept or idea that we introduce from these languages, though.</p>

<p><a href="d9f771cc-9948-4bb5-8ad7-bb6fcbcc62b1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with Rust</em>, gives a brief history on Rust and the motivation behind its design, and covers basic language syntax. The chapter ends with an exercise covering all the language features.<br/></p>
<p><a href="41099eaf-eb1e-4f75-bfdd-628152f59b58.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Managing Projects with Cargo</em>, shows how Rust organizes large projects with its dedicated package manager. This serves as the basis for further chapters. It also covers editor integration with the Visual Studio Code editor.<br/></p>
<p><a href="16c1c837-f1f7-4268-ae8c-6e485a2fd747.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Tests, Documentation and Benchmarks</em>, explores the built-in testing harness, writing unit tests, integration tests, and how to write documentation in Rust. We also cover the benchmarking facilities of Rust code. Later, as a final exercise, we build a complete crate with documentation and tests.</p>
<p> <a href="93373ddb-63dc-4b4c-a42f-7a099818705c.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Types, Generics, and Traits</em>, explores Rust's expressive type system and goes on to explain various ways of using the type system by building a complex number library.<br/></p>
<p><a href="db2c2723-8ca0-43be-b135-afd847342146.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Memory Management and Safety</em>, starts with the motivation for memory management and the various pitfalls in conventional low-level programming languages related to memory. It then moves toward explaining Rust's unique compile-time memory management ideas. We also explain various smart pointer types in Rust.<br/></p>
<p><a href="35bd7e4b-a6ae-400d-bc25-2c3b92b3b630.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Error Handling</em>, starts with the motivation for error handling and explores different models of error handling in other languages. The chapter then examine Rust's error-handling strategy and types, before exploring handling errors in non-recoverable situations. The chapter ends with a library implementing custom error types.<br/></p>
<p><a href="63263043-9b5e-4711-b2e2-e44240a0e843.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Advanced Concepts</em>, explores some of the concepts already introduced in previous chapters, in more detail. It provides details on the underlying model of some of the type system abstractions provided by Rust.<br/></p>
<p><a href="8f3cb215-b8a0-4ed7-bce7-68570687fbd0.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Concurrency</em>, explores Rust's concurrency models and APIs in the standard libraries and teaches you how to build highly concurrent programs with no data races.<br/></p>
<p><a href="7143ebcd-54cc-4e31-a2ad-07ce90268584.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Metaprogramming with Macros</em>, examines how you can write code to generate code using the powerful and advanced macro construct of Rust, and outlines the language's declarative and procedural macros by building both types of macros.<br/></p>
<p><a href="9e9ce701-5f35-4351-b76b-a5f2bd541059.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Unsafe Rust and Foreign Function Interfaces</em>, explores the unsafe mode of Rust and the APIs on offer for interoperating Rust with other languages. The examples includes both calling into Rust from other languages, such as Python, Node.js, and C, as well as covering how Rust can be called from other languages.<br/></p>
<p><a href="cf9c3c2e-5cac-4a41-bf32-ecbf2ea74d6c.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Logging</em>, explains why logging is an important practice in software development, answering why we need logging frameworks, and exploring the crates on offer in the Rust ecosystem that can be used to help integrate logging into the application.<br/></p>
<p><a href="33562886-4278-4ab1-aa0d-de533af4bb99.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Network Programming in Rust Sync and Async I/O</em>, gives a brief introduction to network programming. After going through the basics, the chapter covers building a Redis server that can talk to the official Redis client. Lastly, the chapter explains how to use the standard library networking primitives and the Tokio and futures crates.</p>

<p> <a href="059e4aef-2091-490e-9358-2b8dd620c1f0.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>, <em>Interacting with Databases in Rust</em>, starts with the motivation on the need for database backend applications and moves toward exploring the available crates in the Rust ecosystem to interact with various database backends, such as SQLite and PostgreSQL. The chapter also explores a type-safe ORM crate called diesel. Later, it covers how to integrate our bookmarks API server, built in the previous chapter, to integrate database support using diesel.</p>
<p><a href="71a3ac32-2378-4fe8-a143-25f22f5aa240.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, <em>Rust on the Web Using WebAssembly</em>, explains what WebAssembly is and how it can be used by developers.

                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting the most out of this book</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To really grasp the content of this book, it is recommended that you write out the example code and try fiddling with code to get familiar with the Rust's error messages, so they can guide you toward writing correct programs.</p>
<p>There isn't any specific hardware requirements for this book, and any system with a minimum of 1 GB of RAM and a fairly recent Linux operating system would be fine. All code examples and projects in this book were developed on a Linux machine running Ubuntu 16.04. Rust also offers first-class support for other OS platforms, including macOS, BSD, and recent versions of Windows, so all the code examples should compile and run fine on these platforms too.</p>
