			<h1 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>How Programming Languages Model Asynchronous Program Flow</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we covered asynchronous program flow, concurrency, and parallelism in general terms. In this chapter, we’ll narrow our scope. Specifically, we’ll look into different ways to model and deal with concurrency in programming languages <span class="No-Break">and libraries.</span></p>
			<p>It’s important to keep in mind that threads, futures, fibers, goroutines, promises, etc. are abstractions that give us a way to model an asynchronous program flow. They have different strengths and weaknesses, but they share a goal of giving programmers an easy-to-use (and importantly, hard to misuse), efficient, and expressive way of creating a program that handles tasks in a non-sequential, and often <span class="No-Break">unpredictable, order.</span></p>
			<p>The lack of precise definitions is prevalent here as well; many terms have a name that stems from a concrete implementation at some point in time but has later taken on a more general meaning that encompasses different implementations and varieties of the <span class="No-Break">same thing.</span></p>
			<p>We’ll first go through a way of grouping different abstractions together based on their similarities before we go on to discuss the pros and cons of each of them. We’ll also go through important definitions that we’ll use throughout the book and discuss OS threads in quite <span class="No-Break">some detail.</span></p>
			<p>The topics we discuss here are quite abstract and complicated so don’t feel bad if you don’t understand everything immediately. As we progress through the book and you get used to the different terms and techniques by working through some examples, more and more pieces will fall <span class="No-Break">into place.</span></p>
			<p>Specifically, the following topics will <span class="No-Break">be covered:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Definitions</span></li>
				<li>Threads provided by the <span class="No-Break">operating system</span></li>
				<li>Green <span class="No-Break">threads/stackfull coroutines/fibers</span></li>
				<li>Callback <span class="No-Break">based approaches</span></li>
				<li>Promises, futures, <span class="No-Break">and async/await</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Definitions</h1>
			<p>We can broadly categorize abstractions over concurrent operations into <span class="No-Break">two groups:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cooperative</strong>: These are tasks that yield voluntarily<a id="_idIndexMarker088"/> either by explicitly yielding or by calling a function that suspends the task when it can’t progress further before another operation has finished (such as making a network call). Most often, these tasks yield to a scheduler of some sort. Examples of this are tasks generated by <strong class="source-inline">async</strong>/<strong class="source-inline">await</strong> in Rust <span class="No-Break">and JavaScript.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Non-cooperative</strong>: Tasks that don’t necessarily yield<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> voluntarily. In such a system, the scheduler must be able to <strong class="bold">pre-empt</strong> a running task, meaning that the scheduler<a id="_idIndexMarker090"/> can stop the task and take control over the CPU even though the task would have been able to do work and progress. Examples of this are OS threads and Goroutines (after GO <span class="No-Break">version 1.14).</span></li>
			</ol>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – Non-cooperative vs. cooperative multitasking</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">In a system where the scheduler can pre-empt running tasks, tasks can also yield voluntarily as they do in a cooperative system, and it’s rare with a system that <em class="italic">only </em>relies <span class="No-Break">on pre-emption.</span></p>
			<p>We can further divide these abstractions into two broad categories based on the characteristics of <span class="No-Break">their implementation:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stackful</strong>: Each task has its own call stack. This is often<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> implemented as a stack that’s similar to the stack used by the operating system for its threads. Stackful tasks can suspend execution at any point in the program as the whole stack <span class="No-Break">is preserved.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stackless</strong>: There is not a separate stack<a id="_idIndexMarker092"/> for each task; they all run sharing the same call stack. A task can’t be suspended in the middle of a stack frame, limiting the runtime’s ability to pre-empt the task. However, they need to store/restore less information when switching between tasks so they can be <span class="No-Break">more efficient.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are more nuances to these two categories that you’ll get a deep understanding of when we implement an example of both a stackful coroutine (fiber) and a stackless coroutine (Rust futures generated by <strong class="source-inline">async</strong>/<strong class="source-inline">await</strong>) later in the book. For now, we keep the details to a minimum to just provide <span class="No-Break">an overview.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Threads</h2>
			<p>We keep referring to threads<a id="_idIndexMarker093"/> all throughout this book, so before we get too far in, let’s stop and give “thread” a good definition since it’s one of those fundamental terms that causes a lot <span class="No-Break">of confusion.</span></p>
			<p>In the most general sense, a thread refers to a <strong class="bold">thread of execution</strong>, meaning a set of instructions that need<a id="_idIndexMarker094"/> to be executed sequentially. If we tie this back to the first chapter of this book, where we provided several definitions under the Concurrency vs. Parallelism <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>subsection, a thread of execution is similar to what we defined as a <strong class="bold">task</strong> with multiple steps that need resources <span class="No-Break">to progress.</span></p>
			<p>The generality of this definition can be a cause of some confusion. A thread<a id="_idIndexMarker096"/> to one person can obviously refer to an OS thread, and to another person, it can simply refer to any abstraction that represents a thread of execution on <span class="No-Break">a system.</span></p>
			<p>Threads are often divided into two <span class="No-Break">broad categories:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">OS threads</strong>: These threads are created by the OS<a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> and managed by the OS scheduler. On<a id="_idIndexMarker098"/> Linux, this is known as a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">kernel thread</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User-level threads</strong>: These threads are created and managed<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> by us as programmers without the OS knowing <span class="No-Break">about them.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, this is where things get a bit tricky: OS threads<a id="_idIndexMarker100"/> on most modern operating systems have a lot of similarities. Some of these similarities are dictated by the design of modern CPUs. One example of this is that most CPUs assume that there is a stack it can perform operations on and that it has a register for the stack pointer and instructions for <span class="No-Break">stack manipulation.</span></p>
			<p>User-level threads<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> can, in their broadest sense, refer to <em class="italic">any</em> implementation of a system (runtime) that creates and schedules tasks, and you can’t make the same assumptions as you do with OS threads. They can closely resemble OS threads by using separate stacks for each task, as we’ll see in <a href="B20892_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor092"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a> when we go through our fiber/green threads example, or they can be radically different in nature, as we’ll see when we go through how Rust models concurrent operations later on in Part 3 of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<p>No matter the definition, a set of tasks needs something that manages them and decides who gets what resources to progress. The most obvious resource on a computer system that all tasks need to progress is CPU time. We call<a id="_idIndexMarker102"/> the “something” that decides who gets CPU time to progress <span class="No-Break">a </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">scheduler</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Most likely, when someone refers to a “thread” without adding extra context, they refer to an OS thread/kernel thread, so that’s what we’ll do <span class="No-Break">going forward.</span></p>
			<p>I’ll also keep referring<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> to a thread of execution as simply a <strong class="bold">task</strong>. I find the topic of asynchronous programming easier to reason about when we limit the use of terms that have different assumptions associated with them depending on the context as much <span class="No-Break">as possible.</span></p>
			<p>With that out of the way, let’s go through some defining characteristics of OS threads while we also highlight <span class="No-Break">their limitations.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important!</p>
			<p class="callout">Definitions will vary depending on what book or article you read. For example, if you read about how a specific operating system works, you might see that processes or threads are abstractions<a id="_idIndexMarker104"/> that represent “tasks”, which will seem to contradict the definitions we use here. As I mentioned earlier, the choice of reference frame is important, and it’s why we take so much care to define the terms we use thoroughly as we encounter them throughout <span class="No-Break">the book.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">The definition<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> of a thread can also vary by operating system, even though most popular systems share a similar definition today. Most notably, Solaris (pre-Solaris 9, which was released in 2002) used to have a two-level thread system that differentiated between application threads, lightweight processes, and kernel threads. This was an implementation<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> of what we call M:N threading, which we’ll get to know more about later in this book. Just beware that if you read older material, the definition of a thread in such a system might differ significantly from the one that’s commonly <span class="No-Break">used today.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we’ve gone through the most important definitions for this chapter, it’s time to talk more about the most popular ways of handling concurrency <span class="No-Break">when programming.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Threads provided by the operating system</h1>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note!</p>
			<p class="callout">We call this 1:1 threading. Each task is assigned<a id="_idIndexMarker107"/> one <span class="No-Break">OS thread.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Since this book will not focus specifically on OS threads as a way to handle concurrency going forward, we treat them more <span class="No-Break">thoroughly here.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s start with the obvious. To use<a id="_idIndexMarker108"/> threads provided by the operating system, you need, well, an operating system. Before we discuss the use of threads as a means to handle concurrency, we need to be clear about what kind of operating systems we’re talking about since they come in <span class="No-Break">different flavors.</span></p>
			<p>Embedded systems are more widespread now than ever before. This kind of hardware might not have the resources for an operating system, and if they do, you might use a radically different kind of operating system tailored to your needs, as the systems tend to be less general purpose and more specialized <span class="No-Break">in nature.</span></p>
			<p>Their support for threads, and the characteristics of how they schedule them, might be different from what you’re used to in operating systems such as Windows <span class="No-Break">or Linux.</span></p>
			<p>Since covering all the different designs is a book on its own, we’ll limit the scope to talk about treads, as they’re used in Windows and Linux-based systems running on popular desktop and <span class="No-Break">server CPUs.</span></p>
			<p>OS threads are simple to implement and simple to use. We simply let the OS take care of everything for us. We do this by spawning a new OS thread for each task we want to accomplish and write code as we <span class="No-Break">normally would.</span></p>
			<p>The runtime we use to handle concurrency for us is the operating system itself. In addition to these advantages, you get parallelism for free. However, there are also some drawbacks and complexities resulting from directly managing parallelism and <span class="No-Break">shared resources.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Creating new threads takes time</h2>
			<p>Creating a new OS thread<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> involves some bookkeeping and initialization overhead, so while switching between two existing threads in the same process is pretty fast, creating new ones and discarding ones you don’t use anymore involves work that takes time. All the extra work will limit throughput if a system needs to create and discard a lot of them. This can be a problem if you have huge amounts of small tasks that need to be handled concurrently, which often is the case when dealing with a lot <span class="No-Break">of I/O.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Each thread has its own stack</h2>
			<p>We’ll cover stacks in detail later in this book, but for now, it’s enough to know that they occupy a fixed size of memory. Each OS thread comes with its own stack, and even though many systems allow this size to be configured, they’re still fixed in size and can’t grow or shrink. They are, after all, the cause of stack overflows, which will be a problem if you configure them to be too small for the tasks <span class="No-Break">you’re running.</span></p>
			<p>If we have many small tasks that only require a little stack space but we reserve much more than we need, we will occupy large amounts of memory and possibly run out <span class="No-Break">of it.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Context switching</h2>
			<p>As you now know, threads<a id="_idIndexMarker110"/> and schedulers are tightly connected. Context switching happens when the CPU stops executing one thread and proceeds with another one. Even though this process is highly optimized, it still involves storing and restoring the register state, which takes time. Every time that you yield to the OS scheduler, it can choose to schedule a thread from a different process on <span class="No-Break">that CPU.</span></p>
			<p>You see, threads created<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> by these systems belong to a <strong class="bold">process</strong>. When you start a program, it starts a process, and the process creates at least one initial thread where it executes the program you’ve<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> written. Each process can spawn multiple threads that share the same <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">address space</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>That means that threads within the same process can access shared memory and can access the same resources, such as files and file handles. One consequence of this is that when the OS switches contexts by stopping one thread and resuming another within the same process, it doesn’t have to save and restore all the state associated with that process, just the state that’s specific to <span class="No-Break">that thread.</span></p>
			<p>On the other hand, when the OS switches from a thread associated with one process to a thread associated with another, the new process will use a different address space, and the OS needs to take measures to make sure that process “A” doesn’t access data or resources that belong to process “B”. If it didn’t, the system wouldn’t <span class="No-Break">be secure.</span></p>
			<p>The consequence is that caches might need to be flushed and more state might need to be saved and restored. In a highly concurrent system under load, these context switches can take extra time and thereby limit the throughput in a somewhat unpredictable manner if they happen <span class="No-Break">frequently enough.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Scheduling</h2>
			<p>The OS can schedule<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> tasks differently than you might expect, and <em class="italic">every time you yield to the OS</em>, you’re put in the same queue as all other threads and processes on <span class="No-Break">the system.</span></p>
			<p>Moreover, since there is no guarantee that the thread will resume execution on the same CPU core as it left off or that two tasks won’t run in parallel and try to access the same data, you need to synchronize data access to prevent data races and other pitfalls associated with <span class="No-Break">multicore programming.</span></p>
			<p>Rust as a language will help you prevent many of these pitfalls, but synchronizing data access will require extra work and add to the complexity of such programs. We often say that using OS threads to handle concurrency gives us parallelism for free, but it isn’t free in terms of added complexity and the need for proper data <span class="No-Break">access synchronization.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>The advantage of decoupling asynchronous operations from OS threads</h2>
			<p>Decoupling asynchronous operations<a id="_idIndexMarker114"/> from the concept of threads has a lot <span class="No-Break">of benefits.</span></p>
			<p>First of all, using OS threads as a means to handle concurrency requires us to use what essentially is an OS abstraction to represent <span class="No-Break">our tasks.</span></p>
			<p>Having a separate layer of abstraction to represent concurrent tasks gives us the freedom to choose how we want to handle concurrent operations. If we create an abstraction over concurrent operations such as a future in Rust, a promise in JavaScript, or a goroutine in GO, it is up to the runtime implementor to decide how these concurrent tasks <span class="No-Break">are handled.</span></p>
			<p>A runtime could simply map each concurrent operation to an OS thread, they could use fibers/green threads or state machines to represent the tasks. The programmer that writes the asynchronous code will not necessarily have to change anything in their code if the underlying implementation changes. In theory, the same asynchronous code could be used to handle concurrent operations on a microcontroller without an OS if there’s just a runtime <span class="No-Break">for it.</span></p>
			<p>To sum it up, using threads provided by the operating system to handle concurrency has the <span class="No-Break">following advantages:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Simple <span class="No-Break">to understand</span></li>
				<li>Easy <span class="No-Break">to use</span></li>
				<li>Switching between tasks is <span class="No-Break">reasonably fast</span></li>
				<li>You get parallelism <span class="No-Break">for free</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, they also have a <span class="No-Break">few drawbacks:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>OS-level threads come with a rather large stack. If you have many tasks waiting simultaneously (as you would in a web server under heavy load), you’ll run out of memory <span class="No-Break">pretty fast.</span></li>
				<li>Context switching can be costly and you might get an unpredictable performance since you let the OS do all <span class="No-Break">the scheduling.</span></li>
				<li>The OS has many things it needs to handle. It might not switch back to your thread as fast as <span class="No-Break">you’d wish.</span></li>
				<li>It is tightly coupled<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> to an OS abstraction. This might not be an option on <span class="No-Break">some systems.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Example</h2>
			<p>Since we’ll not spend more<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> time talking about OS threads in this book, we’ll go through a short example so you can see how <span class="No-Break">they’re used:</span></p>
			<p class="SC---Heading" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">ch02/aa-os-threads</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
use std::thread::{self, sleep};
fn main() {
    println!("So, we start the program here!");
    let t1 = thread::spawn(move || {
        sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(200));
        println!("The long running tasks finish last!");
    });
    let t2 = thread::spawn(move || {
        sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100));
        println!("We can chain callbacks...");
        let t3 = thread::spawn(move || {
            sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(50));
            println!("...like this!");
        });
        t3.join().unwrap();
    });
    println!("The tasks run concurrently!");
    t1.join().unwrap();
    t2.join().unwrap();
}</pre>			<p>In this example, we simply<a id="_idIndexMarker117"/> spawn several OS threads and put them to sleep. Sleeping is essentially the same as yielding to the OS scheduler with a request to be re-scheduled to run after a certain time has passed. To make sure our main thread doesn’t finish and exit (which will exit the process) before our children thread has had time to run we <strong class="source-inline">join</strong> them at the end of our <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">main</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> function.</span></p>
			<p>If we run the example, we’ll see how the operations occur in a different order based on how long we yielded each thread to <span class="No-Break">the scheduler:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
So, we start the program here!
The tasks run concurrently!
We can chain callbacks...
...like this!
The long-running tasks finish last!</pre>			<p>So, while using OS threads<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> is great for a number of tasks, we also outlined a number of good reasons to look at alternatives by discussing their limitations and downsides. The first alternatives we’ll look at are what we call fibers and <span class="No-Break">green threads.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Fibers and green threads</h1>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note!</p>
			<p class="callout">This is an example of <strong class="bold">M:N threading</strong>. Many tasks can run concurrently on one OS thread. Fibers<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> and green threads are often referred to as <span class="No-Break">stackful coroutines.</span></p>
			<p>The name “green threads” originally stems from<a id="_idIndexMarker120"/> an early implementation of an M:N threading model used in Java and has since been associated with different implementations of M:N threading. You will encounter different variations of this term, such as “green processes” (used in Erlang), which are different from the ones we discuss here. You’ll also see some that define green threads more broadly than we <span class="No-Break">do here.</span></p>
			<p>The way we define green threads in this book makes them synonymous with fibers, so both terms refer to the same thing <span class="No-Break">going forward.</span></p>
			<p>The implementation of fibers and green threads<a id="_idIndexMarker121"/> implies that there is a runtime with a scheduler that’s responsible for scheduling what task (M) gets time to run on the OS thread (N). There are many more tasks than there are OS threads, and such a system can run perfectly<a id="_idIndexMarker122"/> fine using only one OS thread. The latter case is often referred to as <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">M:1 threading</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Goroutines is an example of a specific implementation of stackfull coroutines, but it comes with slight nuances. The term “coroutine” usually implies that they’re cooperative in nature, but Goroutines can be pre-empted by the scheduler (at least since version 1.14), thereby landing them in somewhat of a grey area using the categories we <span class="No-Break">present here.</span></p>
			<p>Green threads and fibers use<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> the same mechanisms as an OS, setting up a stack for each task, saving the CPU’s state, and jumping from one task(thread) to another by doing a <span class="No-Break">context switch.</span></p>
			<p>We yield control to the scheduler (which is a central part of the runtime in such a system), which then continues running a <span class="No-Break">different task.</span></p>
			<p>The state of execution is stored in each stack, so in such a solution, there would be no need for <strong class="source-inline">async</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">await</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Future</strong>, or <strong class="source-inline">Pin</strong>. In many ways, green threads mimic how an operating system facilitates concurrency, and implementing them is a great <span class="No-Break">learning experience.</span></p>
			<p>A runtime using fibers/green threads for concurrent tasks can have a high degree of flexibility. Tasks can, for example, be pre-empted and context switched at any time and at any point in their execution, so a long-running task that hogs the CPU could in theory be pre-empted by the runtime, acting as a safeguard from having tasks that end up blocking the whole system due to an edge-case or a <span class="No-Break">programmer error.</span></p>
			<p>This gives the runtime scheduler almost the same capabilities as the OS scheduler, which is one of the biggest advantages of systems using <span class="No-Break">fibers/green threads.</span></p>
			<p>The typical flow goes <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>You run some <span class="No-Break">non-blocking code</span></li>
				<li>You make a blocking call to some <span class="No-Break">external resource</span></li>
				<li>The CPU jumps to the main thread, which schedules a different thread to run and jumps to <span class="No-Break">that stack</span></li>
				<li>You run some non-blocking code on the new thread until a new blocking call or the task <span class="No-Break">is finished</span></li>
				<li>The CPU jumps back to the main thread, schedules a new thread that is ready to make progress, and jumps to <span class="No-Break">that thread</span></li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Each stack has a fixed space</h2>
			<p>As fibers and green threads<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> are similar to OS threads, they do have some of the same drawbacks as well. Each task is set up with a stack of a fixed size, so you still have to reserve more space than you actually use. However, these stacks can be growable, meaning that once the stack is full, the runtime can grow the stack. While this sounds easy, it’s a rather complicated problem <span class="No-Break">to solve.</span></p>
			<p>We can’t simply grow a stack as we grow a tree. What actually needs to happen is one of <span class="No-Break">two things:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>You allocate a new piece of continuous memory and handle the fact that your stack is spread over two disjointed <span class="No-Break">memory segments</span></li>
				<li>You allocate a new larger stack (for example, twice the size of the previous stack), move all your data over to the new stack, and continue <span class="No-Break">from there</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The first solution sounds pretty simple, as you can leave the original stack as it is, and you can basically context switch over to the new stack when needed and continue from there. However, modern CPUs can work extremely fast if they can work on a contiguous piece of memory due to caching and their ability to predict what data your next instructions are going to work on. Spreading the stack over two disjointed pieces of memory will hinder performance. This is especially noticeable when you have a loop that happens to be just at the stack boundary, so you end up making up to two context switches for each iteration of <span class="No-Break">the loop.</span></p>
			<p>The second solution solves the problems with the first solution by having the stack as a contiguous piece of memory, but it comes with some problems <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p>First, you need to allocate a new stack and move all the data over to the new stack. But what happens with all pointers and references that point to something located on the stack when everything moves to a new location? You guessed it: every pointer and reference to anything located on the stack needs to be updated so they point to the new location. This is complex and time-consuming, but if your runtime already includes a garbage collector, you already have the overhead of keeping track of all your pointers and references anyway, so it might be less of a problem than it would for a non-garbage collected program. However, it does require a great deal of integration between the garbage collector and the runtime to do this every time the stack grows, so implementing this kind of runtime can get <span class="No-Break">very complicated.</span></p>
			<p>Secondly, you have to consider what happens if you have a lot of long-running tasks that only require a lot of stack space for a brief period of time (for example, if it involves a lot of recursion at the start of the task) but are mostly I/O bound the rest of the time. You end up growing your stack many times over only for one specific part of that task, and you have to make a decision whether you will accept that the task occupies more space than it needs or at some point move it back to a smaller stack. The impact this will have on your program will of course<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> vary greatly based on the type of work you do, but it’s still something to be <span class="No-Break">aware of.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Context switching</h2>
			<p>Even though these fibers/green<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> threads are lightweight compared to OS threads, you still have to save and restore registers at every context switch. This likely won’t be a problem most of the time, but when compared to alternatives that don’t require context switching, it can be <span class="No-Break">less efficient.</span></p>
			<p>Context switching can also be pretty complex to get right, especially if you intend to support many <span class="No-Break">different platforms.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Scheduling</h2>
			<p>When a fiber/green thread<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> yields to the runtime scheduler, the scheduler can simply resume execution on a new task that’s ready to run. This means that you avoid the problem of being put in the same run queue as every other task in the system every time you yield to the scheduler. From the OS perspective, your threads are busy doing work all the time, so it will try to avoid pre-empting them if <span class="No-Break">it can.</span></p>
			<p>One unexpected downside of this is that most OS schedulers make sure all threads get some time to run by giving each OS thread a time slice where it can run before the OS pre-empts the thread and schedules a new thread on that CPU. A program using many OS threads might be allotted more time slices than a program with fewer OS threads. A program using M:N threading will most likely only use a few OS threads (one thread per CPU core seems to be the starting point on most systems). So, depending on whatever else is running on the system, your program might be allotted fewer time slices in total than it would be using many OS threads. However, with the number of cores available on most modern CPUs and the typical workload on concurrent systems, the impact from this should <span class="No-Break">be minimal.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>FFI</h2>
			<p>Since you create your own<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> stacks that are supposed to grow/shrink<a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> under certain conditions and might have a scheduler that assumes it can pre-empt running tasks at any point, you will have to take extra measures when you use FFI. Most FFI functions will assume a normal OS-provided C-stack, so it will most likely be problematic to call an FFI function from a fiber/green thread. You need to notify the runtime scheduler, context switch to a different OS thread, and have some way of notifying the scheduler that you’re done and the fiber/green thread can continue. This naturally creates overhead and added complexity both for the runtime implementor and the user making the <span class="No-Break">FFI call.</span></p>
			<h3>Advantages</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>It is simple to use<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> for the user. The code will look like it does when using <span class="No-Break">OS threads.</span></li>
				<li>Context switching is <span class="No-Break">reasonably fast.</span></li>
				<li>Abundant memory usage is less of a problem when compared to <span class="No-Break">OS threads.</span></li>
				<li>You are in full control over how tasks are scheduled and if you want you can prioritize them as you <span class="No-Break">see fit.</span></li>
				<li>It’s easy to incorporate<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> pre-emption, which can be a <span class="No-Break">powerful feature.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Drawbacks</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Stacks need a way to grow<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> when they run out of space creating additional work <span class="No-Break">and complexity</span></li>
				<li>You still need to save the CPU state on every <span class="No-Break">context switch</span></li>
				<li>It’s complicated to implement correctly if you intend to support many platforms and/or <span class="No-Break">CPU architectures</span></li>
				<li>FFI can have a lot of overhead and add <span class="No-Break">unexpected complexity</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Callback based approaches</h1>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note!</p>
			<p class="callout">This is another example of M:N threading. Many tasks can run concurrently on one OS thread. Each task consists of a chain <span class="No-Break">of callbacks.</span></p>
			<p>You probably already<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> know what we’re going to talk about in the next paragraphs from JavaScript, which I assume <span class="No-Break">most know.</span></p>
			<p>The whole idea behind a callback-based approach is to save a pointer to a set of instructions we want to run later together with whatever state is needed. In Rust, this would be a closure. </p>
			<p>Implementing callbacks is relatively easy in most languages. They don’t require any context switching or pre-allocated memory for <span class="No-Break">each task.</span></p>
			<p>However, representing concurrent operations using callbacks requires you to write the program in a radically different way from the start. Re-writing a program that uses a normal sequential program flow to one using callbacks represents a substantial rewrite, and the same goes the <span class="No-Break">other way.</span></p>
			<p>Callback-based concurrency<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> can be hard to reason about and can become very complicated to understand. It’s no coincidence that the term “callback hell” is something most JavaScript developers are <span class="No-Break">familiar with.</span></p>
			<p>Since each sub-task must save all the state it needs for later, the memory usage will grow linearly with the number of callbacks in <span class="No-Break">a task.</span></p>
			<h3>Advantages</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Easy to implement<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> in <span class="No-Break">most languages</span></li>
				<li>No <span class="No-Break">context switching</span></li>
				<li>Relatively low memory overhead (in <span class="No-Break">most cases)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Drawbacks</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Memory usage grows<a id="_idIndexMarker136"/> linearly with the number <span class="No-Break">of callbacks.</span></li>
				<li>Programs and code can be hard to <span class="No-Break">reason about.</span></li>
				<li>It’s a very different way of writing programs and it will affect almost all aspects of the program since all yielding operations require <span class="No-Break">one callback.</span></li>
				<li>Ownership can be hard to reason about. The consequence is that writing callback-based programs without a garbage collector can become <span class="No-Break">very difficult.</span></li>
				<li>Sharing state between tasks is difficult due to the complexity of <span class="No-Break">ownership rules.</span></li>
				<li>Debugging callbacks can <span class="No-Break">be difficult.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Coroutines: promises and futures</h1>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note!</p>
			<p class="callout">This is another example of M:N threading. Many tasks can run concurrently on one OS thread. Each task is represented as a <span class="No-Break">state machine.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Promises</strong> in JavaScript and <strong class="bold">futures</strong> in Rust are two different implementations<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> that are based<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> on the <span class="No-Break">same idea.</span></p>
			<p>There are differences between different implementations, but we’ll not focus on those here. It’s worth explaining promises a bit since they’re widely known due to their use in JavaScript. Promises also have a lot in common with <span class="No-Break">Rust’s futures.</span></p>
			<p>First of all, many languages have a concept of promises, but I’ll use the one from JavaScript in the <span class="No-Break">following examples.</span></p>
			<p>Promises are one way to deal with the complexity that comes with a <span class="No-Break">callback-based approach.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break">Instead of:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
setTimer(200, () =&gt; {
  setTimer(100, () =&gt; {
    setTimer(50, () =&gt; {
      console.log("I'm the last one");
    });
  });
});</pre>			<p>We <span class="No-Break">can do:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
function timer(ms) {
    return new Promise((resolve) =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}
timer(200)
.then(() =&gt; timer(100))
.then(() =&gt; timer(50))
.then(() =&gt; console.log("I'm the last one"));</pre>			<p>The latter approach is also referred to as <strong class="bold">the continuation-passing style</strong>. Each subtask calls<a id="_idIndexMarker139"/> a new one once <span class="No-Break">it’s finished.</span></p>
			<p>The difference between callbacks and promises is even more substantial under the hood. You see, promises return a state machine that can be in one of three states: <strong class="source-inline">pending</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">fulfilled</strong>, <span class="No-Break">or </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">rejected</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>When we call <strong class="source-inline">timer(200)</strong> in the previous example, we get back a promise in the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pending</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> state.</span></p>
			<p>Now, the continuation-passing style<a id="_idIndexMarker140"/> does fix some<a id="_idIndexMarker141"/> of the issues related to callbacks, but it still retains a lot of them when it comes to complexity and the different ways of writing programs. However, they enable us to leverage the compiler to solve a lot of these problems, which we’ll discuss in the <span class="No-Break">next paragraph.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Coroutines and async/await</h2>
			<p>Coroutines <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>come in two flavors: <strong class="bold">asymmetric </strong>and <strong class="bold">symmetric</strong>. Asymmetric coroutines<a id="_idIndexMarker143"/> yields to a scheduler, and they’re the ones we’ll focus on. Symmetric coroutines<a id="_idIndexMarker144"/> yield a specific destination; for example, a <span class="No-Break">different coroutine.</span></p>
			<p>While coroutines are a pretty broad concept in general, the introduction of coroutines as <strong class="source-inline">objects</strong> in programming languages is what really makes this way of handling concurrency rival the ease of use that OS threads and fibers/green threads are <span class="No-Break">known for.</span></p>
			<p>You see when you write <strong class="source-inline">async</strong> in Rust or JavaScript, the compiler re-writes what looks like a normal function call into a future (in the case of Rust) or a promise (in the case of JavaScript). <strong class="bold">Await</strong>, on the other hand, yields control<a id="_idIndexMarker145"/> to the runtime scheduler, and the task is suspended until the future/promise you’re awaiting <span class="No-Break">has finished.</span></p>
			<p>This way, we can write programs that handle concurrent operations in almost the same way we write our normal <span class="No-Break">sequential programs.</span></p>
			<p>Our JavaScript<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> program can now<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> be written <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
async function run() {
    await timer(200);
    await timer(100);
    await timer(50);
    console.log("I'm the last one");
}</pre>			<p>You can consider the <strong class="source-inline">run</strong> function as a pausable task consisting of several sub-tasks. On each “await” point, it yields control to the scheduler (in this case, it’s the well-known JavaScript <span class="No-Break">event loop).</span></p>
			<p>Once one of the sub-tasks changes state to either <strong class="source-inline">fulfilled</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">rejected</strong>, the task is scheduled to continue to the <span class="No-Break">next step.</span></p>
			<p>When using Rust, you can see the same transformation happening with the function signature when you write something such <span class="No-Break">as this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
async fn run() -&gt; () { … }</pre>			<p>The function wraps the return object, and instead of returning the type <strong class="source-inline">()</strong>, it returns a <strong class="source-inline">Future</strong> with an output type <span class="No-Break">of </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">()</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Fn run() -&gt; impl Future&lt;Output = ()&gt;</pre>			<p>Syntactically, Rust’s futures 0.1 was a lot like the promise example we just showed, and the Rust futures we use today have a lot in common with how <strong class="source-inline">async</strong>/<strong class="source-inline">await</strong> works <span class="No-Break">in JavaScript..</span></p>
			<p>This way of rewriting what look like normal functions and code into something else has a lot of benefits, but it’s not without <span class="No-Break">its drawbacks.</span></p>
			<p>As with any stackless coroutine implementation, full pre-emption can be hard, or impossible, to implement. These functions have to yield at specific points, and there is no way to suspend execution in the middle of a stack frame in contrast to fibers/green threads. Some level of pre-emption is possible by having the runtime or compiler insert pre-emption points at every function call, for example, but it’s not the same as being able to pre-empt a task at any point during <span class="No-Break">its execution.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Pre-emption points</p>
			<p class="callout">Pre-emption points can be thought of as inserting code that calls into the scheduler and asks it if it wishes to pre-empt the task. These points can be inserted by the compiler or the library you use before every new function call <span class="No-Break">for example.</span></p>
			<p>Furthermore, you need compiler support to make the most out of it. Languages that have metaprogramming abilities (such as macros) can emulate much of the same, but this will still not be as seamless as it will when the compiler is aware of these special <span class="No-Break">async tasks.</span></p>
			<p>Debugging is another area where care must be taken when implementing futures/promises. Since the code is re-written as state machines (or generators), you won’t have the same stack traces as you do with normal functions. Usually, you can assume that the caller of a function is what precedes it both in the stack and in the program flow. For futures<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> and promises, it might be the runtime that calls the function that progresses the state<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> machine, so there might not be a good backtrace you can use to see what happened before calling the function that failed. There are ways to work around this, but most of them will incur <span class="No-Break">some overhead.</span></p>
			<h3>Advantages</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>You can write code<a id="_idIndexMarker150"/> and model programs the same way you <span class="No-Break">normally would</span></li>
				<li>No <span class="No-Break">context switching</span></li>
				<li>It can be implemented in a very <span class="No-Break">memory-efficient way</span></li>
				<li>It’s easy to implement for <span class="No-Break">various platforms</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Drawbacks</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Pre-emption can be hard, or impossible, to fully implement, as the tasks can’t be stopped in the middle of a <span class="No-Break">stack frame</span></li>
				<li>It needs compiler support to leverage its <span class="No-Break">full advantages</span></li>
				<li>Debugging can be difficult both due to the non-sequential program flow and the limitations on the information<a id="_idIndexMarker151"/> you get from <span class="No-Break">the backtraces.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>You’re still here? That’s excellent! Good job on getting through all that background information. I know going through text that describes abstractions and code can be pretty daunting, but I hope you see why it’s so valuable for us to go through these higher-level topics now at the start of the book. We’ll get to the examples soon. <span class="No-Break">I promise!</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we went through a lot of information on how we can model and handle asynchronous operations in programming languages by using both OS-provided threads and abstractions provided by a programming language or a library. While it’s not an extensive list, we covered some of the most popular and widely used technologies while discussing their advantages <span class="No-Break">and drawbacks.</span></p>
			<p>We spent quite some time going in-depth on threads, coroutines, fibers, green threads, and callbacks, so you should have a pretty good idea of what they are and how they’re different from <span class="No-Break">each other.</span></p>
			<p>The next chapter will go into detail about how we do system calls and create cross-platform abstractions and what OS-backed event queues such as Epoll, Kqueue, and IOCP really are and why they’re fundamental to most async runtimes you’ll encounter out in <span class="No-Break">the wild.</span></p>
