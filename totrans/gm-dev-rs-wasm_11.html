			<p>While you might have been able to make this small game without testing or debugging, as you develop your own games, you're going to need to prove the games work. You can't do that without writing some tests and debugging some code. You'll want to check performance too, so we'll cover that as well. If you want people to play your game, you'll need a CI/CD pipeline, which is why we'll make one. Finally, we'll look at ways you can expand the game, including interoperating with third-party JavaScript.</p>
