- en: The aim of this book is to give a little tour of some Rust basics (playing with
    GUIs) and advanced (async programming) features. Because interesting projects
    are always a huge plus in a language learning process, we wrote the book with
    this focus. We think this language is awesome and we hope to give you the motivation
    and knowledge in order to have even more rustaceans in the future!

- en: Readers only need a basic knowledge of the Rust language to follow through this
    book if they want to enjoy it the most, even though it's recommended to always
    have the documentation open alongside to answer questions this book might not
    provide (we, authors, aren't almighty, which is a shame, we know). For readers
    who don't know Rust at all, we recommend that they first read the Rust book that
    you can find here at [https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) and
    then come back to read this one!
