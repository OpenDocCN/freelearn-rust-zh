- en: Rocket is one of the first web frameworks in the Rust programming language.
    Rocket provides complete tooling to build web applications, such as tools for
    routing the requests and the strong typing of the incoming requests, and middleware
    to manipulate incoming requests and outgoing responses. Rocket also provides support
    for templating and connections to various databases.

- en: Rocket is a web framework written in the Rust programming language. As one of
    the newer programming languages, Rust is designed to be performant and safe. It
    is easy to create a safe, multithreaded, and asynchronous application. Rust also
    has a strong foundation in its tooling, documentation, and community packages.
    All those strengths contribute to Rust's rapid growth in popularity.

- en: This book explores building a complete web application using the Rocket web
    framework and the Rust programming language. You will be introduced to various
    techniques to build a web application that can handle incoming requests, store
    the data in an RDBMS, and generate proper responses back to any HTTP clients.

    on your computer. You can use Linux, macOS, or Windows. For macOS users, it is
    recommended to use Homebrew. For Windows users, it is recommended to install Rustup
    using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL or WSL 2).
