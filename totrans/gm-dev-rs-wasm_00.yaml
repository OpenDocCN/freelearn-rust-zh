- en: The Rust programming language has held the "most-loved" technology ranking on
    Stack Overflow for 6 years running, while JavaScript has been the most-used programming
    language for 9 years straight, as it runs on every web browser ([https://bit.ly/3JBg4ms](https://bit.ly/3JBg4ms)).
    Now, thanks to WebAssembly (or Wasm), you can use the language you love on a platform
    that's everywhere. This book is an easy-to-follow reference to help you develop
    your own games, teaching you all about game development and how to create an endless
    runner from scratch. You'll begin by drawing simple graphics in the browser window,
    and then learn how to move the main character across the screen. You'll also create
    a game loop, a renderer, and more, all written entirely in Rust. After getting
    simple shapes onto the screen, you'll scale the challenge by adding sprites, sounds,
    and user input. As you advance, you'll discover how to implement a procedurally
    generated world and add sound effects and music. Finally, you'll learn how to
    keep your Rust code clean and organized so that you can continue to implement
    new features and deploy your app on the web. By the end of this Rust programming
    book, you'll have built a 2D game in Rust, deployed it to the web, and be confident
    enough to start building your own games.

- en: This game development book is for developers interested in Rust who want to
    create and deploy 2D games to the web. Game developers looking to build a game
    on a web platform using WebAssembly without C++ programming or web developers
    who want to explore WebAssembly along with JavaScript web will also find this
    book useful. The book will also help Rust developers who want to move from the
    server side to the client side by familiarizing them with the WebAssembly toolchain.
    Some knowledge of Rust programming is assumed, but you do not need to be an expert.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book expects you to have a rudimentary understanding of Rust and doesn't
    cover the syntax. It doesn't expect you to be an expert; you won't be writing
    any macros or complicated traits, so even a Rust cheat sheet should be enough.
    The book is structured as a tutorial and is best worked through beginning to end.
