<ol start="8">
<li>Why do functions need to be boxed when returned from a function?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Functions are traits so they do not have a known size at compile time. Therefore, they must either be parameterized or turned into trait objects with something like <kbd>Box</kbd>.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>What does the <kbd>move</kbd> keyword do?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The <kbd>move</kbd> keyword transfers ownership of variables to new contexts.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>How could two variables share ownership of a single variable?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Indirect references, such as <kbd>Rc</kbd>, permit sharing references to the same data.</p>

<li>In a trait implementation, what is the difference between parameters on the impl, trait, or type?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The <kbd>impl&lt;A,...&gt;</kbd> syntax defines what symbols will be parameterized. The <kbd>Trait&lt;A,...&gt;</kbd> syntax defines what trait is being implemented. The <kbd>Type&lt;A,...&gt;</kbd> syntax defines what type the trait is being implemented for.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>What is the difference between a trait and a data class?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The term <strong>data class</strong> is not a Rust term. Think of a data class as if it were a trait but without fewer limitations than what Rust might impose.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>How should you declare that a package has multiple binaries?</li>

<li>What are four ways of grouping code into modules?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Our workshop model has four ways of grouping code together: by type, by purpose, by layer, and by convenience.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What does FFI stand for?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Why are unsafe blocks necessary?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The <kbd>unsafe</kbd> syntax in Rust indicates that you want to use superpowers and that you accept the responsibility.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Is it ever safe to use unsafe blocks?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Nothing is safe. There is an ongoing effort by core Rust developers to rewrite standard library code to use fewer unsafe features. Still, depending on how far down you look, there is no absolute safety in any context. For example, the core compiler is just assumed to always be logically consistent with regards to safety checks (hopefully it is).</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>What is the difference between a <kbd>libc::c_int</kbd> and an <kbd>i32</kbd>?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><kbd>c_int</kbd> is a direct alias—<kbd>type c_int = i32;</kbd>.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Can linked libraries define functions with the same name?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">C++ uses something called name mangling to export symbols with the same name. However, Rust does not currently recognize this format with <kbd>extern</kbd>.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>What type of files can be linked into a Rust project?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Linked libraries can be of the form <kbd>name.a</kbd><span><em>,</em> <kbd>name.lib</kbd>, <kbd>name.so</kbd>, <kbd>name.dylib</kbd>, <kbd>name.dll</kbd>, or <kbd>name.rlib</kbd>, each with their own format.</span></p>

<li>What is a weak reference?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">A weak reference is a reference that is not reference counted or otherwise managed.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which superpowers are enabled in unsafe blocks?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In an unsafe block, you can dereference a raw pointer, call an unsafe function or method, access or modify a mutable static variable, or implement and unsafe trait.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>When will an object be dropped?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">An object will be dropped when its owner is dropped or goes out of scope.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the difference between lifetimes and ownership?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Lifetimes are a compile-time check. Ownership is a compile-time as well as runtime concept. Both concepts describe the tracking of variables, values, and whether and who uses them.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>How can you be sure that a function is safe?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In Rust, there is no way to declare the absence of unsafe behavior in functions.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>What is memory corruption and how would it affect a program?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">There are two types of memory corruption—physical memory corruption and software memory corruption. If your physical memory is corrupted, then you need to replace your hardware. Software memory corruption refers to anything the program has done to destroy the semantic structure of its own program. When memory is corrupted, everything goes wrong; this is one of the hardest classes of bugs to diagnose and treat.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>What is a contravariant functor?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">A contravariant functor is a functor where the accepted function may produce 0, 1, or many return values. By comparison, functor's accepted functions must return exactly 1 value.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is a monad?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">A monad, parameterized by a single type <kbd>A</kbd>, is a value that has a trait exposing two operations, usually named <kbd>return</kbd> and <kbd>bind</kbd>. <kbd>return</kbd> is a function that constructs a new <kbd>monad&lt;A&gt;</kbd> from a provided <kbd>A</kbd> value. <kbd>bind</kbd> should incorporate new information to produce a related but separate <kbd>monad&lt;B&gt;</kbd>.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What are the monad laws?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">These equivalencies must hold for strict monads. The three horizontal bars means equivalence:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">_return(v).bind(f) ≡ f(v)<br/><br/>m.bind(_return) ≡ m<br/><br/>m.bind(f).bind(g) ≡ (|x| f(x).bind(g))</pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<ol start="5">
<li>What is a combinator?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">A functional combinator combines functions. A combinator more generator combines things.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Why is the impl keyword necessary for closure return values?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Closures are traits, not types. Therefore they do not have a size known at compile time. <kbd>impl</kbd> for a return type tells the compiler to parameterize the return type.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>What is lazy evaluation?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Lazy evaluation is when computation is delayed until some point in the future. This is compared to eager evaluation, where computation occurs immediately.</p>

<li>What is a subprocess?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">A subprocess is a child process started by a parent process. The child process must remain under the parent process to continue to be called a <strong>subprocess</strong>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Why is fork called fork?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">fork means a split (process), like a fork in the road, or a forked tongue.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Is fork still useful?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Yes! If you have access to it on your system. For example, the heartbeat pattern is much more elegant with fork.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>When were threads standardized?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Threads have never been universally standardized. The Posix standard introduced threads in 1995. Notably, Windows provides no standard or guarantees regarding thread behavior. There are similarities, but no standard.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Why is move sometimes needed for thread closures?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Move tells the compiler that it is OK to transfer ownership of captured variables to the closure.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the difference between <kbd>Send</kbd> and <kbd>Sync</kbd> traits?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><kbd>Sync</kbd> is a stronger assertion of thread-safety—a type is <kbd>Send</kbd> if it is safe to send it to another thread. A type is <kbd>Sync</kbd> if it is safe to share between threads.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>What are we allowed to lock, then mutate Mutex without an unsafe block?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The compiler has determined that Mutex is already safe to use and meets certain requirements for safety. That is not to say that bad things can't happen—a Mutex will poison itself if one of its <kbd>MutexGuards</kbd> (the thing it returns when a lock is obtained) is dropped during a panic. Any future attempts to lock the Mutex will return an <kbd>Err</kbd> or <kbd>panic!</kbd>.</p>

<ol>
<li>How is release mode different from debug mode?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">That depends on your Cargo configuration. By default, there are several compiler flags that have different default values in release versus debug mode. One such flag is the opt-level that gets sent to the llvm code generation—the default debug opt-level is 2, and the default release opt-level is 3. These defaults can be changed in <kbd>Cargo.toml</kbd>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>How long will an empty loop take to run?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Test it out. Otherwise, it is hard to say for sure on every platform. loop will always be an infinite loop. while true should maybe also be an infinite loop, but will generate a warning. <kbd>for _ in 0..99999999 {}</kbd> will be removed at opt-level 3 but not opt-level 2.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is linear time in Big <em>O</em> notation?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Linear time is <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>) time.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Name a function that grows faster than exponential growth.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Factorial <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>!) grows faster than exponential growth.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li> What is faster, a disk read or a network read?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Measure it. There are many physical factors to consider here.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>How would you return a Result with multiple error conditions?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Rust recommends using enum types to describe multiple error conditions. Being lazy, you could also use the <kbd>std::any::Any</kbd> type.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>What is a token tree?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">A token tree is a tree data structure containing tokens. As a result of Rust lexing, (...), [...], and {...} token groups will become their own branches.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>What is an Abstract Syntax Tree?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">An abstract syntax tree is like a token tree but it has a strict structure such that only well-formed (Rust) code can be represented by it.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Why do procedural macros need to be compiled separately?</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Procedural macros are written with normal Rust code. To be used in compilation, procedural macros need to have already been compiled.</p>
