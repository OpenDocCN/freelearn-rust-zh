- en: Rust has steadily become one of the most important new programming languages
    in recent years. Like C or C++, Rust enables the developer to write code that
    is low-level enough to make Rust code quickly. And since Rust is memory-safe by
    design, it does not allow code that can crash on a null pointer exception. These
    properties make it a natural choice for writing low-level networking applications.
    This book will enable developers to get started with writing networking applications
    with Rust.

    to Client/Server Networking*, starts the book with a gentle introduction to computer
    networking from the ground up. This includes IP addressing, TCP/UDP, and DNS.
    This forms the basis of our discussions in later chapters.'

    to Rust and its Ecosystem*, contains an introduction to Rust. This is an overall
    introduction that should be good enough to get the reader started. We do assume
    some familiarity with programming.'

    UDP Using Rust*, dives into using Rust for networking. We start with basic socket
    programming using the standard library. We then look at some crates from the ecosystem
    that can be used for network programming.'

    Deserialization, and Parsing*, explains that an important aspect of networked
    computing is handling data. This chapter is an introduction to serializing and
    deserializing data using Serde. We also look at parsing using nom and other frameworks.'

    Layer Protocols*, moves up a layer to look at protocols that operate above TCP/IP.
    We look at a few crates to work with, such as RPC, SMTP, FTP, and TFTP.'

    internet is HTTP. We look at crates such as Hyper and Rocket which are used for
    writing HTTP servers and clients.'

    things already covered in this book. This includes the async/await syntax, parsing
    using Pest, and so on. We will discuss some of these in the appendix.'
