<p>This book is a presentation of the most interesting and useful libraries and frameworks that are freely available for Rust programmers to use in building interesting and useful projects, such as frontend and backend web applications, games, interpreters, compilers, computer emulators, and Linux-loadable modules.</p>
<h1 id="uuid-adf9c52e-3699-4c19-ba4e-e36e9ccaab18">Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for developers who have already learned the Rust programming language and are eager to put it to work to build useful software, whether for businesses or for a hobby project. The book addresses diverse needs, such as building a web application, a computer game, an interpreter, a compiler, an emulator, or a device driver.</p>
<p>Some knowledge of SQL is required to understand the chapter on databases, and knowledge of the C programming language and Linux tools is required to understand the <span>chapter on Linux modules.</span></p>
