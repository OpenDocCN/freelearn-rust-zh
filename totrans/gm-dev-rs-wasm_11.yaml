    as you develop your own games, you're going to need to prove the games work. You
    can't do that without writing some tests and debugging some code. You'll want
    to check performance too, so we'll cover that as well. If you want people to play
    your game, you'll need a CI/CD pipeline, which is why we'll make one. Finally,
    we'll look at ways you can expand the game, including interoperating with third-party
    JavaScript.
