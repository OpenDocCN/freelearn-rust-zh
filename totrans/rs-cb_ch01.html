<p>This chapter is focused on bringing about a behavioral change in you in regard to setting up Rust and programming with it. The objective of this chapter is to make you realize why one should use Rust when there are so many other programming languages out there solving various problems in different verticals--why is there a need for yet another programming language?</p>
<p>These are the fundamental questions that would come to one's mind when they are learning a new language, well Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. As the definition mentions Rust is focused towards eliminating a various class of system programming bugs and errors which at the end of the day helps in making secure, faster, and out-of-the-box production grade applications.</p>
<p>This chapter dives deeper into various assignment operations and their features, data types, and data structures in Rust.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to set up Rust on your system:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Open the Terminal.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">In macOS, you can open the Terminal by pressing the <em>F4</em> key, which opens the launchpad and searches for the Terminal. Then, you can select the Terminal option in the display. This is just one possible way of doing it; there are other ways too.<br/>
In Linux distributions, we can jointly press <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Alt</em> + <em>T</em> to open the Terminal or search for it in the application search window.</div>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Type the following command to install the Rust compiler and Cargo in your system:</li>
</ol>
<pre><strong>      curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh</strong>
</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">You can also try using the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>      curl -sf https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sudo sh</strong>
</pre>
<p>The preceding commands will start the installation, and as it proceeds, the script will require user input. Enter for the default installation, which is the standard way. After this step, different components will be downloaded. If the installation happens without any error, you should be able to see the following screenshot:</p>

<p>A few other commands with the <kbd>rustup.sh</kbd> script are as follows. These commands are not necessary for common usage. The following commands are advanced commands that are not usually used by developers at an early stage of Rust development.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install to a particular location:</li>
</ol>
<pre><strong>      rustup.sh prefix=my/install/dir</strong>
</pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Save the download for faster reinstallation:</li>
</ol>
<pre><strong>      rustup.sh save</strong>

<p>If you try to reinstall Rust after its uninstallation, you'll often get an error saying that <kbd>rustup.sh</kbd> already exists. Please refer the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="98" width="468" src="images/4bc34fc6-3db4-4c10-8a0b-6ce85772f4f2.png"/></div>
<p>To solve the error, just delete the <kbd>.rustup</kbd> executable file from the user space:</p>
<pre><strong>rm -rf /home/viki/.rustup</strong>
</pre>
<p>If the version command doesn't work for you, then you probably have the <span class="packt_screen">PATH</span> environment variable wrong and have not included Cargo's binary directory, which is <kbd>~/.cargo/bin</kbd> on Unix and <kbd>%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin</kbd> on Windows.</p>
<p>This is the directory where Rust development tools are present, and most Rust developers keep it in their <span class="packt_screen">PATH</span> environment variable, which makes it possible for them to run <kbd>rustc</kbd> on the command line.</p>
<p>Due to the differences between operating systems, command shells, and bugs in the installation, you may need to restart your shell, log out of the system, or configure <span class="packt_screen">PATH</span> manually as appropriate to your operating environment.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Rust does not do its own linking, so you'll need to have a linker installed. Doing so will depend on your specific system. For Linux-based systems, Rust will attempt to call <kbd>cc</kbd> for linking. On Rust built on Windows with Microsoft Visual Studio, this depends on having Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools installed. These do not need to be in <kbd>%PATH%</kbd>, as <kbd>rustc</kbd> will find them automatically. In general, if you have your linker in a non-traditional location, you can call <kbd>rustc linker=/path/to/cc</kbd>, where <kbd>/path/to/cc</kbd> should point to your linker path.</div>
<p>If you are still stuck, there are a number of places where you can get help. The easiest is the <strong>#rust--beginners</strong> IRC channel for general discussion, and <span>the <strong>#rust</strong> IRC channel, which we can access through Mibbit. Other great resources include the Rust user's forum and Stack Overflow.</span></p>

<p>The shell script <kbd>rustup.sh</kbd> is a great way to install Rust and has been used by many developers to not only install Rust, but also Cargo on their machines.</p>
<p>The working of this script is pretty straightforward, where the code of the bash script hosted on the rustup server is downloaded on the host system and run automatically by passing the script code to the pipe symbol. The script offers you various installation options through which you can choose the version and type of Rust compiler you want to install. We have the nightly version, which is not the stable one, in Rust's nightly version. This version is used by developers and contributors to test and develop features for their existing projects.</p>

<p>It's similar to Linux and macOS; we have to download the executable and run it, which pops up the Command Prompt where the installation starts. Here, instead of using the shell script, the Rust team provides an executable file for Windows. The executable downloads the Rust compiler and Cargo dependencies on your host system.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Let's go through the code in brief and understand how it is being executed. The Rust compiler looks for the <kbd>main</kbd> function, which is the starting part of the code flow. We have a print statement and the dialogue to be displayed. When we compile the code, an executable is created which on execution will print the dialogue.</p>
<p>Rust files always end in a <kbd>.rs</kbd> extension. If you have to use more than one word in your filename to represent your project it is recommended to use an underscore to separate them for example, we would use <kbd>my_program.rs</kbd> rather than <kbd>myprogram.rs</kbd>, this helps in improving readability.</p>
<p>The keyword <kbd>fn</kbd> defines a function in Rust. The <kbd>main</kbd> function is the beginning of every Rust program. In this program, we have a <kbd>main</kbd> function which does not take any input arguments and returns any type. In case of any arguments, it would go in the parentheses <kbd>(</kbd> and <kbd>)</kbd>. The function body is wrapped in curly braces <kbd>{</kbd> and <kbd>}</kbd>. Rust requires these around all function bodies.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">It's considered good style to put the opening curly brace on the same line as the function declaration, with one space in between.</div>
<p>The <kbd>println!</kbd> macro in the <kbd>std</kbd> Rust crate is used for printing to the standard output, with a newline. Which is inside the body of the <kbd>main</kbd> function and prints the string <kbd>Welcome to Rust Cookbook</kbd>. The line ends with a semicolon (<kbd>;</kbd>). Rust is an expression-oriented language, which means that most things are expressions, rather than statements. The semicolon(<kbd>;</kbd>) indicates that this expression is over, and the next one is ready to begin.</p>
<p>Before running a Rust program, we have to compile it post which we can use an executable file to run the program and print the string in the terminal. The Rust compiler by entering the <kbd>rustc</kbd> command and passing it the name of your source file will create the executable, for example, <kbd>rustc main.rs</kbd> would create an executable <kbd>./main.</kbd> in the same directory.</p>

<pre>        // Primitive libraries in rust<br/>        use std::{i8,i16,i32,i64,u8,u16,u32,u64,f32,f64,isize,usize};<br/>        use std::io::stdin;
</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The <kbd>use</kbd> statement tells the compiler that the program would use the following properties of the library. The <kbd>std</kbd> is an inbuilt library that comes along with the Rust compiler and doesn't need to be externally downloaded. <kbd>i8</kbd> and <kbd>i16</kbd> are different data types of the variable that will be used in the program, and <kbd>stdin</kbd> helps us accept user input from the user:</p>
<pre>        fn main() {<br/>          println!("Understanding assignment");<br/>          // Compiler will automatically figure out the data type if<br/>          not mentioned<br/>          // Cannot change the value<br/>          let num =10;<br/>          println!("Num is {}", num);<br/>        }

<ol start="2">
<li>The output of the preceding script is as follows:</li>

<ol start="3">
<li>Replace the <kbd>main</kbd> function of the preceding script in <kbd>assignment.rs</kbd> file with the following code snippet below:</li>

<pre>        fn main(){<br/>          let age: i32 =40;<br/>          println!("Age is {}", age);<br/>          // Prints the max and min value of 32bit integer<br/>          println!("Max i32 {}",i32::MAX);<br/>          println!("Max i32 {}",i32::MIN);<br/>        }

<li>In the previous code snippet, we declared a variable named <kbd>age</kbd> and explicitly told the compiler that it's a 32-bit integer type data and that we are printing the maximum and minimum values of the 32-bit int data type. Now, the next piece of code:</li>
</ol>
<pre>        // Another way of variable assigning<br/>        let(f_name,l_name)=("viki","d");<br/>        println!("First name {0} and last name {1}",f_name,l_name);
</pre>
<p>Here, we have declared two variables in <kbd>f_name</kbd> and <kbd>l_name</kbd> using <kbd>brackets()</kbd>. This is a way to declare multiple variables in a single statement in Rust. Similarly, while printing them, we can number the position of the variable to determine which variable has to be printed first.</p>

<p>In the previous section, we declared the <kbd>main</kbd> function from where the execution would start. Here, we are declaring a variable named <kbd>num</kbd> and assigning it to a value of 10. The <kbd>let</kbd> statement enables you to declare variables and assigns them to a value. We are not explicitly telling what kind of data type the <kbd>num</kbd> variable is, but during compilation time, it will be automatically determined and memory will be assigned based on that.</p>
<p>The <kbd>num</kbd> value is immutable, which means that its value cannot be changed during the program, and it will be removed from the memory once it goes out of the scope of the <kbd>main</kbd> function. To print the value of the number, we have to use braces; we will cover more of this in detail in the next section.</p>

<p>In the first print statement, we controlled the number of decimal points to be displayed in the Terminal. In the preceding code snippet, we set the value to be two after the colon symbol (<kbd>:</kbd>) in the print statement, which tells the compiler to only print the first two decimal points of the variable in the runtime.</p>
<p>The next print statement displayed Rust's built-in feature that can convert the value to be printed in a different number format. We printed the binary, hex, and octal value of the decimal value 10. To perform this activity, we specifically mentioned the parameter after the colon symbol in the print statement. This is understood by the Rust compiler. At runtime, Rust would automatically convert the decimal type into the mentioned number format, where <kbd>b</kbd> stands for binary, <kbd>x</kbd> for hex, and <kbd>o</kbd> for octal. This has to be given after <kbd>:</kbd> in the print statement.</p>
<p>Next, the <kbd>print</kbd> statement named arguments and we defined the <strong>white space</strong> (<strong>ws</strong>) type we wanted to. We have two arguments here: <kbd>ten</kbd> and <kbd>ws</kbd>. We had control over how we wanted to print the data and what kind of values we wanted to fill <kbd>ws</kbd> with. In the first print statement, we filled it with blank spaces. In the second print statement, we explicitly mentioned zero, which is what we want to fill the gaps with. We declared the named argument inside the curly braces of the print statement and assigned its data value.</p>

<p>In the first set of print statements, we have different types of arithmetic operations being performed on the data set during runtime. The following symbols in the brackets associated with each operation are used to perform the arithmetic operation:</p>
<ul>
<li>addition (<em>+</em>)</li>
<li>subtraction (<em>-</em>)</li>
<li>multiplication (<em>x</em>)</li>
<li>division (<em>/</em>)</li>
<li>modulus (<em>%</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next set of print statements, we performed various mathematical operations, which come built in with the Rust compiler. We declared a variable named <kbd>neg_4</kbd> and assigned it the value <kbd>4i32</kbd>, which is a negative 32-bit integer with the value <kbd>4</kbd>. We set the absolute value of the variable by calling the <kbd>abs()</kbd> function with the variable name <kbd>variable.function</kbd>. Similarly, we performed other mathematical operations, such as <kbd>pow(value)</kbd>, which calculates and applies the power value to the data. The <kbd>round()</kbd> function finds the data to the nearest lower value. The <kbd>ceil()</kbd> function returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the number. And, the <kbd>sin()</kbd> functions return the sine value.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>In this recipe, we assign a variable named <kbd>rand_string</kbd> with a string value of <kbd>I love Rust cookbook</kbd> in which we perform a certain set of string operations.</p>
<p>In the first print statement, we display the length of the string by the <kbd>len()</kbd> method of the str type by calling <kbd>rand_string.len()</kbd> and correspondingly in the next print statement we use the <kbd>split_at()</kbd> method which expects an input argument which splits the string at the value of the argument passed and in our case we call <kbd>rand_string.split_at(7)</kbd> to split at index <kbd>7</kbd> of the string and assign it to the two variables named <kbd>first</kbd> and <kbd>second</kbd>, here space occupies an index value.</p>
<p>In the third print statement, we print the numbers of characters present by using the <kbd>chars()</kbd> and <kbd>count()</kbd> methods, we do it with the following syntax <kbd>rand_string.chars().count()</kbd> where <kbd>chars()</kbd> iterates through the characters and <kbd>count()</kbd> for counting the number of elements.</p>
<p>The <kbd>loop</kbd> is an iterative statement that keeps on running until the break key is called. We used the <kbd>match</kbd> function, which is similar to switch in other languages. We created different conditions for it to check and perform certain actions.</p>
<p>In the <kbd>match</kbd> statements, we have two conditions which are <kbd>Some(x)</kbd> and <kbd>None</kbd>. In both the cases, we perform unique operations which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of <kbd>Some(x)</kbd>, it basically says that <kbd>x</kbd> is a value that exists and has a type <kbd>T</kbd> so we can use the <kbd>x</kbd> variable for further operations and in such cases, we print the value</li>
<li>In the case of <kbd>None</kbd>, it refers to cases where a value does not exist which ideally is the end of the string and the operation we perform at these cases are to break the loop</li>
</ul>
<p>We iterate over three types of conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first set is individual cases, where we print all the characters of the string and is performed by the <kbd>chars()</kbd> and <kbd>next()</kbd> functions with the preceding match statements</li>
<li>The second set is where we print all the different words of the string by splitting in the places of white spaces and is performed by the <kbd>split_whitespace()</kbd> and <kbd>next()</kbd> functions with the preceding match statements</li>
<li>The last ones where we print all the different lines of the string by splitting in the places of next line and is performed by the <kbd>lines()</kbd> and <kbd>next()</kbd> functions with the preceding <kbd>match</kbd> statements</li>
</ul>

<p>An array is a collection of objects that are of the same data type and is stored in contiguous memory. Arrays are always created using brackets <kbd>[]</kbd>, and their size is known at compile time. It is part of their type: [T; size].</p>
<p>Slices are similar to arrays but their size is not known at compile time. The first mark is a pointer value to the data; the second mark is the length of the slice that is selected by the user depending on the application. Slices are usually used to borrow a section of an array and have the type signature and [T].</p>

<p>Here, we declared a variable named <kbd>rand_array</kbd> and assigned it to an array that has three elements inside square brackets: one, two, and three. In the first print statement, we had a question mark (<kbd>?</kbd>) after the colon (<kbd>:</kbd>), which indicates to the print statement that it would print all the elements of the array.</p>
<p>We can address each element of the array by the indices (which refer to the position of the array data element). In Rust, the positioning starts from zero. So when we print <kbd>rand_array[0]</kbd>, it will print the first element. In the third print statement, we used the <kbd>len()</kbd> function to get the length or the number of elements in the array; we used the length function by calling <kbd>rand_var.len()</kbd>.</p>
<p>In the fourth print, we had a new concept called slices. Arrays are borrowed as slices, where we mention the starting value of the pointer and length in the signature. Slices basically reference to a contiguous sequence of the element of the array instead of the whole element.</p>
<p>We printed the complete array by printing <kbd>&amp;rand_var</kbd>, which would print the total array. We also borrowed a section of array using <kbd>&amp;rand_var[1..3]</kbd>, where we mention the size of the slice in square brackets. Here, starting from one, we print all the sections of the numbers until the upper limit of three where one and three are the index values of the arrays which were dereferenced and printed in the Terminal.</p>

<p>Vector is a very important concept in programming and often people get confused between arrays and vectors. Let's demystify the concept. A vector is a dynamic array, which implies that its data allocation can be increased or decreased at runtime, and we will see how this can be done with a simple built-in function. Vectors are implemented in Rust as standard library types, namely <kbd>Vec&lt;T&gt;</kbd>. Here, <kbd>T</kbd> means that we can have vectors of any data type; vectors always allocate their data on the heap and we can create them with the <kbd>vec!</kbd> macro.</p>

<p>We cannot use the vector again if we have iterated by taking ownership of the vector, and for reiterating the vector many times, we have to take a reference to the vector.</p>

<p>A tuple is a unique data structure and is widely used by many developers in their day-to-day development for processing values of different data types.</p>
<p>Generally, tuples are constructed by parentheses <kbd>()</kbd>, and each tuple has a type signature, such as <kbd>T1</kbd>, <kbd>T2</kbd>, ..., where <kbd>T1</kbd> and <kbd>T2</kbd> are the types of its member values.</p>
<p>Tuples are very handy in Rust when we want to return multiple data types. We can use Rust to package them into a single data structure.</p>

<p>The <kbd>std::io</kbd> module contains a number of common things you'll need when. The core part of this module is the read and write traits.</p>
<p>We called the <kbd>read_line()</kbd> method from the <kbd>std::io</kbd> module. The <kbd>read_line()</kbd> method doesn't take a String as an argument; it takes a <kbd>&amp;mut</kbd> String. Rust has a feature called <em>references</em>, which allows you to have multiple references to one piece of data, which can reduce copying. The job of <kbd>read_line</kbd> is to take what the user types as standard input and place it into a string. So it takes that string as an argument, and in order to add the input, it needs to be mutable. In this case, <kbd>io::Result</kbd> had an <kbd>expect()</kbd> method that took a value it was called on; if this isn't successful, our program will crash, displaying a message. If we do not call <kbd>expect()</kbd>, our program will compile but we'll get a warning.</p>
<p>For converting the string into an integer, we used <kbd>trim</kbd> and <kbd>parse</kbd> methods. The <kbd>trim()</kbd> method on the strings eliminates any <kbd>ws</kbd> at the beginning and end of the data. This means that if we type 5 and hit return, guess it would look like this: <em>5\n</em>. The <kbd>\n</kbd> represents a <em>newline,</em> the enter key induced newline will be got rid by <kbd>trim()</kbd> method, leaving behind our string with only the number 5.</p>
<p>The <kbd>parse()</kbd> method on string data parses a string into some kind of number format, since it can parse a variety of numbers, we need to give Rust a hint as to the exact type of number format we want it to convert, that is the reason why we have the statement <kbd>let a_int: i32</kbd>. The colon (<kbd>:</kbd>) after tells Rust we're going to annotate its type, <kbd>i32</kbd> is an integer containing 32-bit size. We used the <kbd>expect()</kbd> method to capture a crash in the cases of an error. The last section of the script was used to conduct regular arithmetic operations.</p>
