- en: Rust is a system programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults,
    and guarantees thread safety. If you are building concurrent applications, server-side
    programs, or high-performance applications, you will benefit from this language.
    This book comes with a lot of application-specific recipes to kick-start your
    developing real-world, high-performance applications with the Rust programming
    language and integrating Rust units into your existing applications. In this book,
    you will find over 85 practical recipes written in Rust that will allow you to
    use the code samples in your existing applications right away.

- en: This book will help you understand the core concepts of the Rust language, enabling
    you to develop efficient and high-performance applications by incorporating features
    such as zero cost abstraction and better memory management. We'll delve into advanced-level
    concepts such as error handling, macros, crates, and parallelism in Rust. Toward
    the end of the book, you will learn how to create HTTP servers and web services,
    building a strong foundational knowledge in server-side programming and enabling
    you to deliver solutions to build high-performance and safer production-level
    web applications and services using Rust.
