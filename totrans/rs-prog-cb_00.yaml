- en: 'Several years ago, I set out learning a new programming language every year
    – as many programmers do. There are many paradigms, rules, and insights to be
    gained from knowing another programming language, and then I found Rust. Rust
    turned out to be too much fun to write to simply move on, and after the steep
    learning curve, it became even more fun. So, there I had it: having learned a
    total of two additional (TypeScript and Rust) languages, I stuck to Rust. Why?
    Let''s find out.'

- en: Rust is a systems programming language that provides memory safety by default
    without a garbage collector, which impacts its runtime behavior. Regardless of
    this fact, Rust is a very versatile language that can be used across various domains,
    be it web programming, game engines, or web clients. Moreover, it challenges conventional
    thinking about scopes and memory allocation, making you a better programmer in
    any language, be it C#, Java, or Python. The latest push on the part of companies
    such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google shows that the ecosystem has now evolved
    to a point where things are stabilizing enough for enterprise usage – a great
    sign for a future Rust professional.

    cases to make you productive fast. We have tried to cover a wide range of applications
    and hope you find useful concepts as well as solutions that are directly applicable to
    your daily development work.

- en: This book is not your typical book to learn a programming language. Instead
    of diving deep into concepts, we want to show a range of possible projects, solutions,
    and applications that provide further links to concepts and other resources. Thus,
    we think this book is for anyone looking to get into practical applications quickly
    – regardless of their Rust experience. However, programming fundamentals (in any
    language) are required – they are the fundamental base your Rust skills will rest
    on.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](c6b2f137-b846-48cc-a378-5c2fccce4114.xhtml), *Starting off with
    Rust*, covers how to set up Rust toolchains on your computer and the fundamental
    constructs of the language. These range from writing tests and benchmarks to language
    constructs such as loops, `if` expressions, traits, and structs.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](db0ca1d0-05a4-4bb9-b10a-8511b78e22c9.xhtml), *Going Further with
    Advanced Rust*, answers questions about more in-depth features of the language
    as well as patterns for creating meaningful programs. Topics include borrowing
    and ownership in complex scenarios, the `Option` type, pattern matching, generics,
    explicit lifetimes, and enums.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](cdcbf36d-9343-4b7b-ace1-b4c570dab62c.xhtml), *Managing Projects
    with Cargo*, uses the `cargo` tool to manage additional crates, extensions, projects,
    and tests. You will find recipes that empower you to work on larger projects and
    solve challenges faced in managing them.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](eb7f566a-00ca-4e6c-bc05-4e9d00bf8c56.xhtml), *Fearless Concurrency*, goes
    into some best practices and recipes to build safe, fast programs. In addition
    to this, popular libraries such as Rayon are presented as we demonstrate that
    Rust is a great language for doing all kinds of concurrent tasks.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](898e8c94-b6e0-41d4-a06a-6fd95fb88466.xhtml), *Handling Errors and
    Other Results*, explains how Rust uses the `Result` type and panics to perform
    error handling, integrating most failure cases into a regular workflow that needs
    to be treated. This chapter shows applicable patterns and best practices around
    avoiding unexpected crashes and unnecessary complexity.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](a8fae7de-6021-4d6e-9c75-e24288bc92e7.xhtml), *Expressing Yourself
    with Macros*, explains how Rust''s unique macro system extends the functionality
    of programs before compilation—in a type safe way. These macros can be implemented
    for many possible custom scenarios, and many crates use this ability. This chapter
    is all about creating useful macros to make your life easier and your programs
    safer.'

    with Other Languages,* uses and works with different binary units and languages
    from within Rust in order to port legacy software or benefit from better SDKs.
    This is realized mostly through the **Foreign Function Interface** (**FFI**),
    which enables quick and easy integration with other native binaries. On top of
    that, it is possible to publish to `npm` (the Node.js package repository) from
    Rust using WebAssembly. These and other things are discussed in this chapter.'

    web programming – `actix-web`, which showcases an actor-based approach to handling
    requests, in productive use at Microsoft.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](d229ae85-1922-45fc-ab87-b1de7a533f9b.xhtml), *Systems Programming
    Made Easy*, explains how Rust is a great choice for running workloads on small
    devices with limited resources. In particular, the lack of a garbage collector
    and the resulting predictable runtime makes it a great fit for running sensor
    data collectors. Creating such a loop together with the required driver to read
    data is what we cover in this chapter.'

    with Rust*, covers practical considerations in Rust programming, such as parsing
    command-line arguments, working with neural networks (machine learning with PyTorch''s
    C++ API), searching, regular expressions, web requests, and much more.'
