- en: Welcome. The aim of this book is to teach beginner and moderate Rust programmers
    how to exploit modern parallel machines in the Rust programming language. This
    book will contain a variety of information relevant specifically to the Rust programming
    language, especially with regard to its standard library, but it will also contain
    information that is more generally applicable but happens to be expressed in Rust.
    Rust itself is *not* a terribly inventive language. Its key contribution, from
    where I sit, is the mainstreaming of affine types with application to memory allocation
    tracking. In most other respects, it is a familiar systems programming language,
    one that ought to feel familiar—with a bit of adjustment—to those with a background
    in GC-less programming languages. This is a good thing, considering our aim here
    is to investigate concurrency—there is a wealth of information available in the
    papers and books written about this subject, and we understand and apply their
    concepts. This book will reference a number of such works, whose contexts are
    C++ , ATS, ADA, and similar languages.

- en: If this is your first Rust programming book, I warmly thank you for your enthusiasm,
    but encourage you to seek out a suitable introduction to the programming language.
    This book will hit the ground running, and it will likely not be appropriate if
    you've got questions about the basics. The Rust community has produced *excellent* documentation,
    including introductory texts. The Book ([https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/)),
    first edition, is how many who are already in the community learned the language.
    The second edition of the book, still in progress at the time of writing, looks
    to be an improvement over the original text, and it is also recommended. There
    are many other excellent introductions widely available for purchase, as well.

- en: This book covers a deep topic in a relatively short space. Throughout the text,
    the reader is expected to be comfortable with the Rust programming language, have
    access to a Rust compiler and a computer on which to compile, and execute Rust
    programs. What additional software appears in this book is covered in [Chapter
    1](5f3aec9d-fd53-48ff-9ba8-43ce13e91cff.xhtml), *Preliminaries – Machine Architecture
    and Getting Started with Rust*, and it is recommended for use but not mandatory.

- en: The basic premise of this book is as follows—parallel programming is difficult
    but not impossible. Parallel programming can be done, and done well, when attention
    is paid to the computing environment and care is put into the validation of the
    produced program. To that end, each chapter has been written with an eye toward
    imparting a solid foundation to the reader of the chapter's subject. Once a chapter
    is digested, the reader will, hopefully, have a solid path into the existing body
    of literature on that subject. In that, this is a book of beginnings, not ends.

    download the source code, investigate the projects as you read through independent
    of the book's take, and probe the running programs with the tools available on
    your operating system. Like anything else, parallel programming ability is a skill
    that is acquired and honed by practice.

- en: One final note—allow the process of learning to proceed at its own pace. If
    one chapter's subject doesn't immediately settle in your mind, that's okay. For
    me, the process of writing the book was a confluence of flashes of insight and
    knowledge that unfolded slowly like a flower. I imagine that the process of reading
    the book will proceed analogously.
